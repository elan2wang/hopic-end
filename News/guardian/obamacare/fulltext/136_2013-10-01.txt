Twitter users are facing the earth-shattering news today that they will have to survive without tweet notifications of impending asteroid strikes. In a final tweet before suspension, Nasa's Asteroid Watch Twitter account admitted that the service has been switched off as part of the US government's Congress stalemate-induced shutdown. "In the event of government shutdown, we will not be posting or responding from this account. We sincerely hope to resume tweets soon," it said in a tweet on 30 September.

An estimated 800,000 federal workers will be forced to stay at home during the shutdown, and will have an immediate affect on the fragile US economy and services, Barack Obama has warned.  • After weeks of wrangling, the American government has been forced into a shutdown over politics and Obamacare

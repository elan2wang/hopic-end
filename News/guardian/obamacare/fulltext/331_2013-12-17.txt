Just before Christmas Eve, there's another important piece of shopping to do: 23 December is the last day this year that consumers can select a health insurance plan on the government's Healthcare.gov website. While the site has been improved in the three weeks since its relaunch, many stayed away while the bugs were being worked out. We know readers will have questions about the signup process, ranging from details on subsidies and deductibles to how to pay for your first bill. Neil Weingarten, vice-president of broker operations at Conference Associates, Inc, will take questions from our readers in a live webchat right here on this page. Weingarten has trained over 250 health insurance brokers on the ins and outs of the ACA to prepare them to educate consumers and small businesses. You can recap the chat in below and read all of Neil's answers. <a href='http://www.coveritlive.com/mobile.php/option=com_mobile/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=a8cb6a74a3' >ACA healthcare enrollment &acirc;ï¿½ï¿½ web chat</a>

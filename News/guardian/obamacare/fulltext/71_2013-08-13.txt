3.49pm BST Good afternoon, Katie Allen here taking over from my colleague Angela Monaghan. As she mentioned earlier, news of a pick-up in industrial production in the eurozone earlier today has bolstered expectations that the currency bloc will be shown to have finally exited recession when official GDP data are released in the morning. Here is a round-up of tomorrow's main data releases in the eurozone: France kicks things off with second quarter GDP numbers at 6.30am UK time. The consensus forecast in the Reuters poll of economists is for quarterly growth of 0.2% after a drop of 0.2% in the first quarter. French July inflation figures are at 7.45am. At 7.00am, German second quarter GDP data is expected to show quarterly growth of 0.6% after 0.1% in the first quarter. Austrian, Dutch and Portuguese GDP data are also due out. The focus will be on second quarter GDP data for the whole eurozone, due at 10.00am. Economists expect growth of 0.2% after a decline of 0.2% in the first quarter. Following today's industrial production data, Peter Vanden Houte at ING Financial Markets sends through this comment on tomorrow's likely numbers. With a 1.2% quarter-on-quarter increase, the industrial production figure is compatible with a 0.3% GDP expansion in the second quarter. This would mark the end of the 6 quarter recession in the eurozone. Todayâ€™s report shows that the recession has probably ended in the eurozone. However, with a new bail-out needed in Greece and the economic situation still fragile in most of the peripherals, a subdued recovery is probably the best we can hope for.

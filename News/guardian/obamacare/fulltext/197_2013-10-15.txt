3.33pm ET House Republicans could pass legislation tonight that could find bipartisan support in the Senate, according to Rep. Devin Nunes, Republican of California, a confidante of speaker John Boehner. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Nunes expressed exasperation with the House' hard-right faction, saying it was "lunacy" to shut down the government in an effort to stop Obamacare. Boehner had no choice but to give in to the demands of his caucus to try it, however, Nunes asserts. "This vote tonight is something that has support," Nunes said. "We need 218 votes to pass, because the Democrats" aren't going to vote for the bill. In a play to win Tea Party support for the bill, Nunes said, the leadership was including the "Full Vitter." The Vitter amendment would strip congressional members and staff who lost health coverage through Obamacare of money for replacement coverage.  The Vitter amendment is popular with the Tea Party, which takes it to be an accountability measure.  Nunes pretty much conceded to Bash that the amendment was needlessly harmful to staff members who need health care. "The problem is, we're at the 11th hour, this is what it takes to get the votes" so we're going with it, Nunes said. Nunes said if the House Republicans unilaterally pass a new bill, "Harry Reid is going to have a tough decision to make. Because it will then be Harry Reid's default." That argument sounds familiar somehow.

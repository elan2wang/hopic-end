8.04pm GMT As was to be expected, the meeting between Barack Obama and his arch-opponents, the House Republicans, was not a meeting of minds. One red-faced and beefy Republican, heaving his way up the corridor away from the meeting, summed up what seemed to be the consensus of his colleagues. Asked if it had been a good meeting, he hesitated and shrugged, before delivering a grudging comment. "It was all right," he said. Obama, leaving the committee room, was asked by waiting television crews not about the meeting but about the pope. He confirmed he had been passed a note and announced it at the meeting but still did not know, at that point, the identity of the new pope. One of the TV journalists asked him if there had been a similar puff of white smoke to emerge from the Obama-Republican meeting, he chided that this was stretching the analogy a little too far. But he characterised the meeting as "good" and "useful". A few minutes later, at a Republican press conference, House speaker John Boehner described it as "productive". A string of Republicans drifting from the meeting would not have disputed the adjectives, but the tone was different. They were glad Obama had come to see them, but it had not changed their minds. There had been few surprises and there appeared to be little room for compromise. The president spoke about reform of entitlements and they liked that. A few said they could contemplate surrendering on closing a few more tax loopholes, which would in effect be a tax rise. But on the whole, the gap on spending and tax remained wide. They said they could see more scope for compromise on immigration but little on guns. The main theme raised by Republicans was suspicion that Obama was only meeting them for political presentation purposes, and they questioned his sincerity, saying it would become clear in the months ahead whether he really wanted compromise.

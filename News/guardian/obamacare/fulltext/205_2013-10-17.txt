11.11pm ET Crisis over. All it took was a couple of easy votes to have a funded government and not destroy the global economy by arbitrarily sabotaging the world's reserve currency. For another three months, at least. Was that so hard? Oh, was it ever. To recap: • The House and Senate both passed a bill this evening funding the government and raising the debt ceiling until early 2014. President Obama says he will sign it "immediately," as in, tonight. • The 16-day government shutdown is over. Government employees will receive retroactive pay for the shutdown period. • Fiscal talks will now shift to a budget conference between the House and Senate, where a negotiated report is due by mid-December. The talks will be led by the budget committee chairs of each chamber, senator Patty Murray and congressman Paul Ryan. • President Obama will speak tomorrow about his budget priorities. He claims that he's willing to discuss "anything." • Speaker Boehner, despite passing a bill with mostly Democratic support, is not expected to lose his job. He even got a standing ovation from the House Republican conference today. Here's our fully story from the Guardian's Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts and correspondent Paul Lewis.

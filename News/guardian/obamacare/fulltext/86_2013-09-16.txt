7.39am BST Janet Yellen, vice chair of the US Federal Reserve, could now succeed Ben Bernanke as Fed chair. Photograph: ROBERT GALBRAITH/REUTERS Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world.  European stock markets are set to rally this morning following the surprise news last night that Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary, has withdrawn from the race to become the next chairman of the US Federal Reserve. The former US Treasury secretary threw in the towel yesterday, seemingly daunted by the prospect of a bruising fight with Congress. The move throws the race to succeed Ben Bernanke wide open, with the Fed on the very brink of deciding whether to begin slowing its huge monetary stimulus programme. The new front-runner appears to be Janet Yellen, Fed vice-chair since 2010 - a popular choice with Democrats and many in the financial markets and the media. As well as having helped guided Fed policy through the crisis, Yellen is credited with a rare knack of reading economic trends -- including predicting in 2009 that the recovery would be "frustratingly slow". Economists and analysts believe Yellen is more likely than Summers to maintain a robust stimulus programme, meaning more easy money for Wall Street and the City. Summers' withdrawal has already hit the dollar, driving sterling to its highest level since January. The pound is up by 0.8 cents this morning, to $1.59.5. Emerging markets have rallied overnight, with Thailand's stock market up almost 3% and India up 1%. European stocks are expected to surge too, while bond yields should probably slide -- on the prospect of the Fed buying even more US debt than under Larry Summers.

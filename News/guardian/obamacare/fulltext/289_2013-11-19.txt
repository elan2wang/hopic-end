4.58pm ET We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here's a summary of where things stand: • Obama blamed Republicans for contributing to the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act. "One of the problems we've had is one side of Capitol Hill is invested in failure," Obama said. • Health secretary Sebelius asked consumers to try out the web site again. "It is far faster than it was when we first opened," Sebelius said. • The section of the health care web site that processes subsidy payments to insurers might not be built until mid-January, government officials said. The administration had been saying the site would be fully operational by the end of November. A top official said the site is only 60-70% built. • President Obama was briefed on a consultant's memo warning about likely problems with the rollout of the healthcare.gov web site, the White House said. The memo, by McKinsey & Co, warned of "insufficient time and scope of end-to-end testing," and "volume uncertainty." • Republicans at a House hearing questioned how the president could have been briefed on the memo and continued to predict a successful rollout for the site. The Washington Post on Monday night first reported on the memo's dire warnings. • No security flaws have been detected with the health care web site, which has undergone security testing and meets federal standards for sites with sensitive information, the CMS official, Henry Chao, testified. The site, meanwhile, has come under attack by hackers, the Guardian's Alex Hern reported.

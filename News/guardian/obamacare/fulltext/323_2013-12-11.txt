9.33am ET Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage of an appearance by health secretary Kathleen Sebelius before Congress to answer questions about – what else? – Obamacare. It's Sebelius' third trip to the Hill since the October launch of the faulty healthcare website, and her first appearance before this particular subcommittee of the House committee on energy and commerce. The rather exasperated title of this morning's hearing: "PPACA Implementation Failures: What's Next?" ("Obamacare" is shorthand for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA.) Kudos to the committee there for limiting themselves to just one question mark. Congressman Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania, will chair the proceedings. Before the hearing, the Department of Health and Human Services released new signup numbers that showed the total number of signups to insurance plans in both the federal and state marketplaces in November was 365,000, three times the amount who signed up in the technically plagued month of October. Some 110,400 of that number signed up in the federal exchange, four times the October number. Sebelius also announced that the inspector general of health and human services would conduct an inquiry into the botched development of healthcare.gov. In previous congressional appearances, Sebelius has been assertive bordering on combative, taking responsibility for lurches in the healthcare rollout but not taking any guff from Republican legislators. The legislators, in turn, have competed to consume the most oxygen in slamming the law – and, not incidentally, the witness. Not taking any guff: Sibelius at a previous congressional hearing. Judging from a background memo published on the committee website, today's hearing will focus on problems with Obamacare including canceled plans, higher costs and potential site security vulnerabilities. Democrats are expected to argue that Republicans are exaggerating problems with the law.

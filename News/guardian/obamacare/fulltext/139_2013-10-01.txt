The US government shut down at midnight Tuesday for the first time in nearly two decades. As thousands of workers await news of their essential-or-not employment status, many ‘non-essential’ government services were shutdown: national parks, monuments, even Nasa. By Tuesday morning, the first signs of the government shutdown began to surface on social media, in the form of tweets from the agencies themselves The social media accounts for several government agencies – from Nasa to the US army – posted 'away' messages, because their federal minders had been deemed non-essential to the workings of US government.  To clarify: Many observatories, astronomers are watching the skies.

Yosemite’s 123rd birthday was ruined – making for the most awkward Google Doodle we’ve seen in a while.  <em></em> In Washington, the source of the gridlock, the Lincoln Memorial was actually open to visitors early this morning – but then it wasn’t: The Lincoln Memorial is still open to vistors early Tuesday morning.... #shutdown pic.twitter.com/t9EkG56b1f— Doug Mills (@dougmillsnyt) October 1, 2013 Photo outside Lincoln Memorial.

Obamacare exchanges just opened and the panda cam at the National Zoo just got turned off. #strangethingshappenatmidnight— albertmohler (@albertmohler) October 1, 2013 In DC, park police are even barricading park entrances: Park Police barricade road along National Mall and #Smithsonian museums. #shutdown #obamacare pic.twitter.com/BsVDWUROdJ— M.

This is an unexpected break for a lot of government workers, and in previous shutdowns, they’ve always been paid. But they're scaling back the services they provide starting today. Some examples: the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is working with a reduced staff and is not tracking outbreaks of flu and influenza and the National Institutes of Health will treat patients but will not begin any new clinical trials.  Meanwhile, those workers deemed ‘essential’ are actually facing long lines to actually get into work:  But what about those ‘non-essential’ workers? In a happy turn of events, the shutdown coincided with the release of Grand Theft Auto online. Coincidence? Due to the government shutdown, I will be drinking and playing GTA V. If anyone needs a handyman or yard work, hit a ginger up.— Charles Howe (@chuckhowe78) October 1, 2013 I'm 99% sure the Government shutdown to play GTA Online.— Air Rick (@Lega_c) October 1, 2013 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN GONNA AFFECT GTA V ONLINE TODAY ?— Ernest (@LmaoAtDoseHoes) October 1, 2013 The truth is. The government shutdown to take a couple of days off to play NBA 2k14 and GTA V online.— Charlamagne Tha God (@cthagod) October 1, 2013 Let's not forget Twitter-venting.  Of course, people vented on Twitter in true democratic internet style. The #DearCongress hashtag started by the Today show has people spewing their anger out in 140 characters or less. Productive! What's your message for Congress? Tell us in the comments below or by tweeting your #DearCongress ideas to @GuardianUS; we’ll add them below. #DearCongress - If working class government employees will have to lose their paycheck during this, you should, too.— P Scott Patterson (@OriginalPSP) October 1, 2013 #DearCongress I teach my students adding & subtracting so they can balance their checkbooks when they're adults. It's time to balance yours.— Mr. Messina (@Mr_Messina) October 1, 2013 #DearCongress It's absolutely shameful of you to use innocent people and their livelihoods as leverage. Enjoy that uninterrupted salary.— Jennifer (@mintlipgloss) October 1, 2013 #DearCongress lol pic.twitter.com/YtbEBBM7aK— kayl nicole (@heyKAYL) October 1, 2013 #DearCongress please don't come back.

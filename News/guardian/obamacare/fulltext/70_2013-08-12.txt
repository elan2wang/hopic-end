New Jersey’s Democratic candidates for US Senate are a diverse bunch, but they almost all have one thing in common: you have probably never heard of them. Frank Pallone is a 14-term congressman who emphasizes his work on passing Obamacare. Rush Holt has served eight terms in the House, is a nuclear physicist, and once owned Watson at a Jeopardy! tournament. State assembly speaker Sheila Oliver would be the first woman and African American elected to the US senate from New Jersey. Despite their records, all three are very unlikely to be New Jersey’s next senator. That’s because Cory Booker, mayor of Newark – who you have heard of, thanks to his superhuman feats, extrovert personality, endless media connections, and well-documented Twitter habit – is leading the Democratic primary field in the special New Jersey senate race, with a Quinnipiac University survey showing 54% of likely voters ready to tick the box next to his name. As for the other candidates, Pallone is running at 17%, Holt 15% and Oliver 5%. (On the Republican side, Steve Lonegan is the frontrunner over Rutgers professor Alieta Eck. The winners will face off in a 16 October election.) With one day to go until the Democratic primary, things aren’t looking good for the candidates trailing Booker. His rivals could probably use a pick-me-up and, luckily, the mayor’s Twitter and Facebook pages are overflowing with wisdom and inspirational quotes on redemption, kindness, forgiveness – and failure. And if Cory Booker says it’s going to be all right, we have no choice but to believe him. Candidates, here’s his advice for getting through what is sure to be a disappointing election: The next few hours are going to be tough.

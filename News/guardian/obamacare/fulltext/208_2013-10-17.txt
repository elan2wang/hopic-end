2.51pm BST People head to work near Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC. Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP Time for a summary of events so far today. The US has averted the risk of a catastrophic debt default after Congress finally agreed a spending bill to reopen the Federal government and extend the debt limit. The short-term deal, signed after midnight Washington time (read it here) gives the government the authority to borrow until early February, and also approves budget spending until January 15th. Here's the key points. Hundreds of thousands of government workers have been asked to return to their desks, as analysts ponder the political fallout. The IMF also weighed in, urging America to avoid a repeat of the debt ceiling debacle that has loomed over the global economy. The short-term nature of the deal has disappointed the financial markets, who expect a repeat of recent deadlock and conflict in the months ahead. Most European stock markets have fallen so far today. Wall Street just opened in the red, with the Dow dropping over 100 points in early trading.  Early this morning, China's Dagong agency downgraded the US credit rating, from A to A-. It warned that: The government is still approaching the verge of default crisis. The dollar has lost ground in the currency markets, amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will continue its stimulus programme at the current rate until March 2014.  On a brighter note, the cost of insuring US debt has dropped, and the prices of short-term Treasury bonds have risen. Financial experts are relieved that the risk of a US technical default is off the agenda, at least until early 2014. But many expect further brinkmanship and conflict on Capitol Hill in the coming months. Here's some early comment ...and here's a bit more. In Washington, Democrat and Republicans will begin discussing long-term budget issues, as part of the 'budget conference' agreed in the deal.

8.55am ET Good morning, this is Jim Newell in Washington. We're here to cover what will presumably be the most unpleasant day of acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller's soon-to-be-over career. Miller, who was fired on Wednesday, officially stays on duty until next Wednesday. And today he will join J Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, as a witness in a hearing before the House Ways and Means committee on the IRS's "practice of discriminating" against organizations for political purposes. It will be the first hearing with Miller as a witness since news broke two weeks ago that applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status, frequently those with names including terms like "Tea Party," were singled out by the IRS for extra scrutiny starting in early 2010. Three years later, some have still not been processed. George's IG report, released on Tuesday, found that "inappropriate criteria were used to identify tax-exempt applications for review," and made a series of recommendations for the IRS to take going forward. Its released prompted the administration to relieve Miller of his (acting duties). Miller will have a lawyer at today's hearing. He does face the threat of self-incrimination if he chooses to speak. And with lawmakers on both sides, but especially Republicans who've been concerned about the IRS' alleged practice of selective enforcement in the past, looking to jam him, it will be a tense morning. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 9am.

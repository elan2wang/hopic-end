Time for CPAC fashion watch! This, you will recall, is an Important Issue, which we sent Katie Rogers to investigate: In 2012 a conservative blogger wrote that many of the ladies of CPAC looked "either looked frumpish or like two-bit whores," and earlier this week another blogger, Adrienne Royer, attempted to be helpful by telling women outright what they shouldn't wear. Royer refrained from using the word "whore" or any of its synonyms in her viral Pinterest infographic this week advising that women refrain from wearing miniskirts, Tom's shoes and strapless dresses. She also included a few obvious tips for men -- no T-shirts, jeans or sneakers.  But not everyone followed the rules. Many of the violators were of the elusive young voter crowd the GOP has been trying to court at the conference audibly via One Direction.  For Ryan Bolyard, president of the Hillsdale College Republicans, exhaustion dictated his wardrobe choice.  "I rolled off the bus at 8am after a red eye bus trip with 66 Hillsdale [College] students," a denim-wearing Ryan Bolyard, 21, said. "I changed into a clean T-shirt and haven't been back to change since."  The clean T-shirt was apparently one of the 1,200 free "Stand With Rand" tees doled out as conference swag.  Others, like Meryl Ertlet, 22, and Susan Willis, 18, visiting with a group from Providence College, didn't consider their mini skirts to be that mini.  "At PC it's not a mini skirt," Ertlet said. "I probably took about 20 minutes to get ready."

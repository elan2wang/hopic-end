12.07pm ET Welcome to our liveblog coverage of the vote on the bipartisan budget deal that emerged Tuesday evening. A successful day could open the way to Congress passing its first full budget since 2009. Golf clap. The deal at hand is designed and expected to pass. It sidesteps the big disagreements between the parties over taxes and entitlement spending. It was co-authored by congressman Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. A key benefit of the deal, which extends for two years, is that it averts a possible government shutdown scenario at the start of 2014 and another at the end of the current fiscal year in October. “Alleviating government shutdowns alleviates a lot of the uncertainty that has been plaguing this country, this capital,” Ryan said in presenting the deal. Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan) is in the House chamber to watch the debate. Both House speaker John Boehner and minority leader Nancy Pelosi have thrown their support behind the bill. This being Washington, however, there is potential for drama, if not derailment. Hard-right conservatives in the House and probable Republican presidential candidates in the Senate have come out against the deal. The left has its complaints, too, chief among them that the bill does nothing to extend the unemployment insurance that 1.3m people are set to lose at the end of the year. We'll look at the details of the budget deal as the debate unfolds. The official summary of the deal is here [pdf]. Updated at 12.13pm ET

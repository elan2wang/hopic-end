President Obama: time running out? Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP As the hours tick down to the Monday night deadline ahead of the first US government shutdown in 17 years, here's a timeline of what to watch for: Saturday House of Representatives are expected to vote on a new, continuing resolution that includes postponing Obamacare for a year and repealing a linked tax on medical devices that would have helped pay for it. A separate bill authorising military spending is also expected. Sunday The bill will be returned to the US Senate, where senators were asked not to leave Washington this weekend so they would be available for emergency debates on votes. The Democratic majority are expected to reject the House's resolution either on Sunday or Monday, but may not be able to mount a vote if obstructed by Republicans such as Ted Cruz. Monday Democratic leaders in the Senate may attempt talks with House Republicans to try to reconcile their two contradictory positions, but this seems unlikely before the midnight deadline for federal spending authorisation expires. Tuesday Under the Anti-Deficiency Act passed in the 1880s, federal government officials are prohibited from spending money except for essential staff. Who is deemed essential will be determined by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which has published a preliminary list here. October 15 Many government paychecks and benefit payments are due and could be disrupted if the shutdown is still in place October 17 Treasury secretary Jack Lew has calculated that this is the time the government will breach its current borrowing limit unless Congress agrees to a separate decision to extend the debt limit.

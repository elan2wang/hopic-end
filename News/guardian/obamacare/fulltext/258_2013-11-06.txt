3.09pm ET And that about covers a day of reactions to last night's, well, mostly unsurprising election results. What did last night's elections mean? They meant a lot. Here's a look back at some of the day's developments: • Terry McAuliffe's slim margin of victory of Ken Cuccinelli in the Virginia governor's race was rich with all sorts of meaning. Some questioned whether the "win" was a "victory." Some saw a rebuke of Obamacare, while others saw an embrace of Obamacare. But the point is, McAuliffe did win, and much of the credit for that victory goes to African-American voters. • Chris Christie's blowout reelection as governor of New Jersey was also rife with meaning, so much meaning. Is he the frontrunner for 2016, since he can win Latino voters? Would his personality serve as a "trump card" over all the petty little orthodoxies that define presidential primaries? And think of the all big bucks he'll rake in as chair of the Republican Governors Association. Go ahead and think big, the man enjoys all the flattery you have to offer. • NYC mayor-elect Bill de Blasio met with outgoing mayor Mike Bloomberg for the first time today. A comical photo was taken, and photoshopped to become even more comical. Bloomberg will now become a blogger. • The Virginia attorney general's race is extremely close and likely headed to a recount. • No one is calling anyone.

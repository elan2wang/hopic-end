1.37pm GMT • Nick Clegg has criticised Theresa May for drawing up "illegal and undeliverable" proposals to impose a cap on the number of EU citizens who can come to work in the UK. As Nicholas Watt reports, in some of his harshest criticisms of the home secretary, the deputy prime minister said many Tories were foolishly flirting with Britain's exit from the EU, a move that he said would undermine Britain's ability to shape events in Europe. My advice to the Home Office is to spend less time leaking policies that are illegal and undeliverable and spend more time delivering on the policies that we have agreed as a coalition government, notably the reinstatement of exit checks. I remain very frustrated that the Home Office has still not delivered something which I personally insisted should be in the coalition agreement, which is a reinstatement of the checks which allow us to know not only who is coming into this country but who is leaving as well. Beyond that I would just state the obvious. If we pulled up the drawbridge now and said to German lawyers or Finnish engineers or Dutch accountants they can't come to work it would be a disaster for our economy. We are an open economy. The City of London would grind to a halt overnight. It would be very unwelcome to the two million Brits who work abroad. Earlier May said that she wants a clampdown on the way EU citizens are permitted to come to the UK, but avoided confirming leaks coming from her department suggesting she wants a cap of 75,000 EU workers. • The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry has published a survey suggesting firms in the capital thinks opening the labour market to Bulgarian and Romanian migrants will have a beneficial effect. As the Press Association reports, more than half of respondents to the survey - 52% - currently employ migrant workers, while 55% believe immigration has had a positive impact on London's economy. In its report "Let them come? EU migration and London's economy", LCCI found that over 58% of London businesses stated that a short supply of candidates with the relevant skills was their main reason for employing EU workers. Colin Stanbridge, chief executive of LCCI said: Migration is a highly emotive issue yet the debate often fails to recognise that this city needs migrants for its economic future ... The government has allowed the debate about Bulgarian and Romanian migration to become highly politicised when, in fact, giving London businesses easier access to a larger labour pool can only be beneficial going forward. • The Home Office has said that a new statutory duty to report potential victims of trafficking in the modern slavery bill published is expected to bring help to an extra 1,500 victims in Britain every year.Details of the bill are here. Frank Field, the Labour MP who produced a report on the extent of modern slavery for the Home Office, said David Cameron should make this a priority for the G8 and the Commonwealth. We’re suggesting two things. One is the prime minister is a member of G8, that he actually raises and pushes the issue there; but since apartheid, the Commonwealth has not had a great big moral issue around which it can group, and I’m hoping the prime minister actually puts it to the Commonwealth and says ‘instead of fighting amongst ourselves, why don’t we get a real important issue which is important to the world and put our efforts into that?’. But Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says the bill does not go far enough. Modern Slavery Bill doesn't go far enough. We need protection for trafficked children.

As Angela Monaghan reports, the industry said plots are built on as soon as planning permission is secured, and argued that the 557% increase in profits among the nation's four biggest housebuilders this year comes from a very low base following the financial crisis. In a separate move, Nick Clegg attacked Miliband's proposal at his press conference. [Labour] are avoiding making any pronouncements on the major economic judgments they would need to make if they were to find themselves in government, instead favour a series of populist, gimmicky policy pronouncements.  We have seen it today with the pronouncement from Labour on housing. This is from a party which saw an absolute crash, a collapse, in social housing stock in the years that they were in charge. Waiting lists soared for those who were waiting to get onto the housing ladder, and the number of empty homes soared as well. This is hardly a party well-placed now to provide lectures on how to rectify the problems in the housing market.  • The Lords conduct committee has said that two peers, Labour's Lord Mackenzie and the Ulster Unionist Lord Laird, should be suspended from the Lords after being recorded offering to do paid parliamentary work by undercover reporters. • David Cameron has declared mission accomplished in Afghanistan after 12 years of British involvement in the conflict, despite fears of a surge of violence from the Taliban around next year's elections. As Rowena Mason reports, the prime minister made the bold claim as he visited Camp Bastion, the British base in Helmand province, almost exactly a year before all UK fighting troops are due to be withdrawn from the country. The embargo on reporting Cameron's visit today has just been lifted. Cameron was accompanied on the trip by the former England footballer Michael Owen who was helping to launch a football partnership with Afghanistan. • Labour has released figures showing that the cost of home care services has gone up £740 a year since the general election. It released the figures ahead of this afternoon's second reading debate on the care bill.  • Campaigners have complained that the care bill will give officials the power to scrap hospital services undemocratically. The Green MP Caroline Lucas said that clause 118 would allow trust special administrators, who take over failing NHS hospitals, to close services. She said:  There is much in the care bill that is positive. It’s disappointing therefore that the Government is using it to smuggle in a dangerous and undemocratic change which will make it much easier for popular and successful services to be closed. This is a major issue for my constituents, and for anyone who cares about the NHS, or local democracy. People absolutely have to have a say on changes that threaten the services they rely on.  Unite has been campaigning on this too.

As the Press Association reports, the Foreign Office insisted the Falklands were not subject to a new law passed last month by the Argentine Congress and accused Buenos Aires of "bullying tactics" in the long running dispute over the sovereignty of the islands. The FCO director for the Americas, Kate Smith, has now lodged a formal protest with the Argentine charge d'affaires, Oscar Horacio Galli. An FCO spokesman said: Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands, so this is a baseless gesture intended to deter legitimate commercial activity. We are confident it will not succeed. It is shameful that Argentina is once again adopting bullying tactics in an attempt to strangle the Falkland Islands economy.  Updated at 1.42pm GMT

David Cameron is still using his mobile phone despite claims that the US tapped the phone of Angela Merkel. Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters David Cameron is still using his mobile phone following revelations about US spying on foreign leaders, Downing Street has signalled. Asked whether the British prime minister was comfortable with using his phone after news that the NSA had allegedly monitored calls made by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, his spokesman appeared to confirm Cameron was still using the same mobile "Yes, I haven't seen him use a different one," he said. Britain and the US â along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand â are members of the Five Eyes group, who share signals intelligence and are supposed to not spy on each other. Downing Street has refused to comment on allegations published in the Guardian that the US tapped the phones of up to 35 foreign leaders, including Merkel and members of the French administration. However, Cameron has given his backing to a statement signed by the 28 EU heads of state saying a lack of trust could harm co-operation in intelligence-gathering with the US, despite Britain's close co-operation with the American agencies. All leaders have agreed on the text, but Cameron will come under pressure to give his personal view in a press conference in Brussels. The statement said EU leaders had discussed how the recent revelations about US surveillance based on leaks by the whistleblower Edward Snowden had raised deep concerns among European citizens. France and Germany were seeking urgent talks on the extent of US spying, and other countries may join their calls for a new code of conduct.

9.47am BST Welcome to Middle East Live.  Here's a roundup of the latest news: Egypt • US senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are in Cairo for talks aimed at breaking the impasse between Egypt's interim military-backed government and supporters of the ousted president Mohamed Morsi. US President Barack Obama has asked them to meet representatives of both sides.  • Egypt's military leaders are understood to have offered to include the Muslim Brotherhood in a political process that gives the vanquished movement three ministerial posts in a unity government and frees some members from prison. A security source told the Guardian: Within the framework of national reconciliation there have been promises made by the government to the Brotherhood, but only after they clear the sit-ins and end the protests. These promises include three ministerial posts in the new government; unfreezing the assets of the senior Muslim Brotherhood and only letting out of prison those who have not incited violence against the state. The Egyptian military and the presidency later denied that talks had taken place, or that any offers had been made to the Brotherhood. • The US deputy secretary of state, William Burns, met the detained deputy leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Khairat al-Shater in Cairo on Monday night, a state department spokesman confirmed. Marie Harf said: The visit was conducted in the context of ongoing diplomatic efforts to prevent further violence, calm tensions, and facilitate an inclusive dialogue among Egyptians that can help the transition to a democratically elected civilian government. I would also underscore that this meeting was done with the cooperation of the Egyptian authorities. Syria • Syrian rebels led by al-Qaida militants have captured a major air base in the north of the country after months of fighting, activists have claimed. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Mannagh helicopter base, near the border with Turkey, fell nearly 24 hours after rebels, led by al-Qaida-linked militants, launched an all-out offensive against it. The Aleppo Media Centre said rebels finally captured it before dawn. Mannagh, in the north of Aleppo province, is deep inside territory dominated by the Syrian opposition. Rebels have been trying since last year to capture it, but faced strong resistance from defenders. This video purports to show the attack on the air base.  EA WorldView has a round-up of purported videos of the attack and its aftermath. • Syria's crisis will be solved by military might not negotiations, President Bashar al-Assad has said. The Irish Independent reports: In a rare speech, the Syrian president, newly buoyant from his victories against the rebels in the central city of Homs, deemed his political opposition a "failure" and said his army would crush "terrorism", referring to the country's insurgency. "No solution can be reached with terror except by striking it with an iron fist," he said. Turkey • Turkey is facing angry divisions after a former armed forces commander was sentenced to life imprisonment with 16 other retired officers for their role in an alleged terrorist plot to overthrow the country's Islamist-rooted government. Underlining the tensions surrounding the case, security forces fired tear gas outside the court as supporters of the defendants gathered to protest. The five-year trial has become a battle between an increasingly unpopular ErdoÄan and Turkey's secular establishment. Turkey is still reeling from mass protests in June that saw Taksim Square in the centre of Istanbul, shut down. Yemen • A surveillance aircraft flying over the capital Sana'a has captured the attention of residents today, with many posting video and pictures on social media. The white 4 engined aircraft, shown in this video, appears to be Navy P-3 surveillance aircraft.   •The unarmed plane was spotted as Yemeni security officials said a suspected US drone had killed four alleged al-Qaida members in the al-Arqeen district of the eastern Marib province. • The US state department today ordered the evacuation of non-emergency government workers from Yemen due to threats.The US had already issued a global travel alert because of a threat of possible al-Qaida terrorist attacks and closed 21 US embassies in the region, prompting Britain and Germany to also close their embassies in Yemen. • US officials have told the New York Times the Obama administration's decision to issue a worldwide travel alert came after the United States intercepted electronic communications in which the head of al-Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahri, ordered the leader of the group’s affiliate in Yemen to carry out an attack as early as this past Sunday. An official told the NYT:  This was significant because it was the big guys talking, and talking about very specific timing for an attack or attacks. The claim has been used to bolster the case for the National Security Agency's sweeping surveillance powers, revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Updated at 3.52pm BST

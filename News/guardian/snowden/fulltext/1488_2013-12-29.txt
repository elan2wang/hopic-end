The unknown Edward Snowden becomes one of the most famous faces on the planet. Photograph: The Guardian/AFP/Getty Images Along with journalist colleagues Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, I spent six days with Edward Snowden in Hong Kong. He had spent almost all of his short adult life working in America's spy agencies, but at the end of those six days, the unknown 29-year-old became one of the most famous faces on the planet. He went public in a Guardian video, revealing himself as the source of one of the biggest leaks in western intelligence history. Glenn initially interviewed Snowden to establish whether he was who he said he was, and I followed up on the second day. At first I was sceptical of his story â he seemed so young to have packed in so much: training for the special forces, CIA in Geneva, NSA in Japan. After a few hours, I was convinced and sent a pre-arranged message to the Guardian: "The Guinness is good." We met every day, for formal interviews or just to chat. Each day, getting a taxi over to the hotel in Kowloon to see him, I was always expecting to find that he would have disappeared, been lifted by the CIA or the Hong Kong police. It remains one of the biggest puzzles of the Snowden affair that the CIA did not snatch him. Flight records should have been available. He was signed into the Mira under his own name and using his own credit card. And Glenn made at least one appearance on CNN that was datelined Hong Kong. Tracing him would not have taken long. I came to admire him, partly because of his modesty but mainly for his courage.

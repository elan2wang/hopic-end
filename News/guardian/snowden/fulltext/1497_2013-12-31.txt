It's been a busy news year, and as 2013 draws to a close the time has come to sit back and take stock. Judging by the most viewed articles on the Guardian site in 2013, it is clear which story dominated, with stories related to Edward Snowden and his revelations about the NSA taking six of the top 20 places. We want to know which stories you think we should have looked at in more detail over the past year, and which stories you think we covered too much. We put the question to our readers on Twitter, who came up with a few suggestions. Some thought we gave too much coverage to the royal family, and not enough of international politics. Other popular suggestions for topics that warranted more coverage included the coalition's treatment of the NHS, and the ongoing effects caused by the government's welfare reforms. Now it's over to you. Share your thoughts in the open thread below. And we're talking about articles tagged news, rather than culture, so save your thoughts on selfies and Cyrus for another thread.

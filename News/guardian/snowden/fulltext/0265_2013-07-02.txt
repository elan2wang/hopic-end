Why should we get used to it? In his article Britain had better get used to it (21 June), Martin Kettle fails to mention that, while politics have changed, our political institutions have not. Society has achieved levels of education and communication unimagined at the time our political institutions were created. Kettle is mistaken in his advice that we cannot or should not compete with other nations in the way we do politics. Every society needs to take a critical look at its political institutions and assess their compatibility with the principles of democracy. Does a democracy â government by the people â need a strong leader? Is there no other way? Is the division of a parliament into government and opposition benches consistent with democracy's principles? Do we really believe that only one party at a time can have all the answers to all the problems? How can we expect such an arrangement to respond fairly and adequately to the wide range of legitimate interests and needs of a highly educated, mobile, and interconnected society? Too many of the world's democracies are moving toward greater concentration of political power in a handful of executives, following the lead of and in partnership with global corporations. I don't care for Kettle's advice that we "better get used to it." My advice is that we better do something about it. AndrÃ© Carrel Terrace, British Columbia, Canada Turkey's coup risk Timothy Garton Ash's article regarding the current state of unrest in Turkey (21 June) fails to mention the possibility of a military coup. Military coups are not new to Turkey. If the military feels that the government of the day, democratically elected or not, is straying from the Kemalist tradition of secularism, then it may act. Previous coups have occurred in 1960, 1971 and 1980. In the 1960 coup the prime minister, Adnan Menderes, was executed. I'm sure prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is aware of recent history even if Garton Ash is not. Ken Cotterill Mareeba, Queensland, Australia Iraq's unconventional pain John Pilger's article, West has moved on but Iraqis cannot (31 May), needs to be repeated and augmented in every news medium and gathering of political and peace-campaigning activists. These should include CND, for whose persistent campaigns governments (and oppositions) have habitually reserved labels of unrealistic idealism; because Pilger's shocking report shows the grey definition between "conventional" battlefield weapons and weapons of mass destruction. The use of depleted uranium carries, along with mass destruction, such capacity for long-term genetic harm that its apparent deployment by British and US forces in Iraq puts the clock back half a century and puts our leaders â past and present â to withering shame. Pilger's article merely hints at the cost being borne by Iraq, by its medical institutions and hard-pressed doctors and cancer specialists. It is a cost that must be shared by the perpetrators of the 2003 invasion and should, with the necessary inclusion of depleted uranium in the detail of the Chilcot Inquiry (or its possible successor), be levied at Tony Blair and his government, which prescribed the use of such catastrophic and non-strategic weapons in the first place. Ian Angus London, UK Locking out pensioners It should be heartwarming to read of the firm commitment of both UK government and opposition to the principle of the pension "triple lock". (Balls: I'll be tough on benefits, 14 June). However, neither Ed Balls nor George Osborne remembers to add: "excepting of course those pensioners who elected to retire to Canada, Australia, South Africa â¦" Around a quarter of a million of us have never received a single pension increase, despite having fully paid our way in the UK, for no other reason than that we chose to live in a Commonwealth (!) country, often to be with emigrated children. Had we the foresight to retire to Japan, or Croatia, or the US, or almost anywhere else, our pensions would have been automatically indexed by the triple lock. Quite apart from the blatant unfairness of this illegitimate policy based on place of residence, the falling purchasing power of our fixed pensions, coupled with the decline in the value of sterling, has created real hardship for many UK pensioners abroad. A further irony (News in Brief, same issue) was to read that Jeremy Hunt's review of A&E care will focus on "vulnerable older people, who (are) the heaviest users of the NHS". Not us, Jeremy: we don't cost the NHS a penny. William Langford North Saanich, British Columbia, Canada The drive to collaborate Re: Ally Fogg's assertion that there is nothing more antisocial than driving (14 June). Witness the flow of traffic at roundabouts, the merging of traffic on motorways where individual solids merge into a fluid flow of traffic. Multiply this event by a million, no, hundreds of millions, zillions of such maneuvers, day and night, rain or shine, light or dark throughout the world. Why can't this amazing level of human cooperation and acceptance of basic rules be translated into other areas of human endeavor; managing disagreements in Syria, influencing dysfunctional governments, sorting out differences with neighbours for example. Can we learn something from this amazing example of collaboration? Driving must be the finest example of human cooperation, it can hardly be considered antisocial. Graham Kirby Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia Emotional breakdown Oliver Burkeman (This column will change your life, 21 June) suggests that the medical profession seriously considers referencing The Emotionary, a website that was apparently designed to spur the invention of clever polysyllabic words to describe feelings and emotions, like the admittedly tongue-in-cheek "incredulation", which is synonymous to those old standbys, surprise and elation. I suggest that instead of inventing new words for diagnosing patients, "baffled psychologists" couldn't do better than to consult hard-copy dictionaries (by subject) of metaphors, quotations, lines of poetry, especially Shakespeare, and synonyms of words and phrases. Browse, and feel good again. Richard Orlando Montreal, Quebec, Canada â¢ Interesting as it is, Oliver Burkeman's item does not make it clear whether he is referring to feeling or emotion. He uses both words as if they were synonymous, sometimes even in the same sentence. But Arthur Janov, in The Primal Scream, says that they are not the same. In critical situations, such as in a court of law, we tend to judge defendants by whether or not they display an emotional reaction to a guilty or innocent verdict. Or when someone receives a gift or an act of kindness, we often expect an effusive emotional response, and judge them as cold and unfeeling without such a response. But it is unhelpful to judge the depth of a person's feeling by their ability to put on a display of emotion. True feeling, according to Janov, requires little emotion. Clive Wilkinson Morpeth, Northumberland, UK â¢ The article by Oliver Burkeman on the new Emotionary website reminded me of an incident at my very traditional, boys-only grammar school in the 1950s. When we came across the word "emotions" in an English lesson, one boy asked what it meant. The master thought for a moment and then said that "emotions are things that women have". We consequently added them to bras and periods as distinguishing features of the other gender but were none the wiser! Philip Lund Nantwich, Cheshire, UK Briefly â¢ Re: Edward Snowden and the NSA, if America can't keep tabs on one of its own, within the US or outside, why should we try to justify its view of itself as the world's policeman by all means: military, assassination, espionage? Edward Black Church Point, NSW, Australia â¢ Ai Weiwei writes of the abuse of power by the state (21 June). The media has more power to abuse. It is our source of news of the world. It is the final filter. In the hands of an independent media, government cannot abuse in secret. With the co-operation of the media, government and/or industry can do anything. Art Campbell Ottawa, Ontario, Canada â¢ I'm shocked that Araucaria, who was educated at the same school as I was in Oxford, should perpetrate the commonly held misconception (7 June) that the koala (4 down) is a bear (7 down). Even so, I still reckon his crosswords to be the best, the most fun, and the most satisfying to "break". Keith Short Fortaleza, Brazil Please send letters to weekly.letters@guardian.co.uk

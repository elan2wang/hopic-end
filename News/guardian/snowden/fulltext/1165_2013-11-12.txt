Court is not the problem I was shocked that the African Union would ask for something so contrary to the rule of law and the proper functioning of a democracy (Africa asks: don't target sitting leaders, 18 October). While I agree that there is something wrong in the fact the International Criminal Court (ICC) is only prosecuting Africans, it is not clear that the fault lies with the court itself. It is astounding that the AU would seek to protect sitting leaders from ICC prosecution, a protection that is in direct conflict with the foundation of civil societies. Surely there must be some ability to prosecute sitting leaders where the evidence is strong and the crime serious or else government will be seen as the sanctuary for criminals. Cynics would say the only corrupt leaders at risk of imprisonment are the ones who weren't fully committed to undermining all civil and judicial norms. If they were more tenacious, they might embroil former colonial powers in their conflict or begin a civil war. This would raise the financial stakes and begin a humanitarian crisis, precipitating a comfortable exile or eventual front-page praise when they are forced to limit the scope of their slaughter. However, the ICC is working against this perception and the AU's recent request undermines the ICC and the hopes of many Africans. To prevent sitting leaders from rigging elections, embezzling, taking bribes, and more importantly torturing and murdering opposition leaders to maintain power, I suggest that one doesn't tell them they are immune from prosecution so long as they remain in office. The AU's attempt to protect sitting leaders only promotes the idea that a troubled incumbent should simply commit more crimes to stave off election defeat and prosecution. To change the status quo, I suggest that the AU propose stronger civil protections rather than become an apologist for the crimes of sitting leaders. Dave Scott Toronto, Canada Feigned ignorance is exposed Some politicians have strenuously denied causal links between climate change and extreme weather when it suits them to do so. The current Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, denied such a connection in the case of the recent New South Wales bushfires (Bushfires "not down to climate change", 1 November). Increasingly, however, such feigned ignorance is being exposed. What is it about probability that these people do not understand? Professor Will Steffen, of the Australian National University, explained on ABC national radio recently that climate change "loads the dice" in favour of more frequent and more intense fires and cyclones. Others point out that global reinsurers, whose business depends on accurately assessing risk, don't doubt the link between climate change and catastrophic weather events. They increase their premiums accordingly. The way to reduce climate change risk is to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And, as reports on the economics of climate change by Nicholas Stern and Ross Garnaut have shown, the sooner we do this, the less it will cost and the greater will be our chance of success. David Teather Canberra, Australia â¢ Two articles in the 1 November Guardian Weekly deserve further comment: World Roundup, Bushfires not down to climate change, and Environment, Stark warning on need for new targets in Australia. Australia's new prime minister, Tony Abbott, is hostile to warming science. Infamously on record as saying that "climate change is a load of crap", he has criticised as "hogwash", scientific opinion that temperature records throughout winter and spring are responsible for an early fire season. His disrespect for science is now policy. Without explanation, for the first time in 70 years, Australia is without a minister for science. He axed the position. Similarly, he is winding up the Australian Climate Change Authority. These are not the actions of a prime minister with an inquiring mind. For Australians who wish to avert the worst effects of climate change, Abbott's election and scientific illiteracy could not have come at a worse time. History's naysayers have a new champion. Galileo and Darwin knew their kind. Warren Tindall Bellingen, NSW, Australia A deadly chess game John Pilger's article, China's role in Africa is Obama's obsession (18 October) makes for scary reading: China's bid for world hegemony is part of a deadly chess game in which the southern hemisphere land masses of Africa and Australia are exploited by China for their raw materials, and are simultaneously targeted by the US as sites for military bases â with China as their chief focus. Throw in a re-militarised Japan and a massive US build-up on Guam, and the world sits poised for Armageddon, for once without Israel in the mix. Pilger needs to realise that it's just the world's two super powers jockeying for position. Nobody wants a war that cannot be won, especially "the son of Africa in the White House", as Pilger disparagingly refers to Obama, who cares more about welfare reform at home than foreign adventures. Dave Hughes Lerala, Botswana Offering an open forum Two features in the 8 November Guardian Weekly have led me to the same conclusion: Spain's communist model village and the item on the poll about the BBC's alleged bias under News in brief. The first piece, an extract from the book The Village Against the World, by Dan Hancox, is unlikely to have been published by the popular media, with their emphasis on making the failed market system more acceptable to the public. The second illustrates why I, and many like me, are consciously blind to the supposed leftwing bias of the BBC, the Guardian and, here in Australia, the ABC. It comes back to how we define intelligence. If we define it as the willingness and the capacity to take into account all the relevant data and to adapt our behaviour accordingly, then one fact becomes quite clear â all three institutions are simply fulfilling their charter: to offer an open forum for informed and informal debate on the key issues of today. In other words, to demonstrate the manifestation of collective intelligence. If being unbiased must ultimately be reduced to offering equal exposure to all possible views on a topic, then perhaps the same sanction should be applied to the Murdoch media, with their universal manifesto, which is to support the status quo, regardless of the cost and long-term consequences. Which would of course mean expanding the current media almost exponentially. Oh well, we would still have the Guardian Weekly, I suppose. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland Australia Catton is a Canadian The reference to "her native New Zealand" in Charlotte Higgins' interview with Eleanor Catton (25 October) is incorrect. The Man Booker prize winner is not a native New Zealander. To turn a commonplace New Zealand patriotic description on its head, she is "Canadian-born". Nevertheless, having read The Luminaries and despite having some reservations about its conceits, style and structure, I congratulate Catton on her skill, learning and effort in writing such an absorbing and monumental book. She fully deserves the critical acclaim, and the personal study she is looking forward to having. Philip Evans Eastleigh, UK Briefly The admission by US secretary of state John Kerry that neither he nor the president were aware of some of the country's surveillance activities must have come as a huge embarrassment for the Obama administration (8 November). Nevertheless, were it not for the revelations by Edward Snowden, both Kerry and his boss would still be in the dark on this matter. Isn't it reasonable, therefore, to forgive Snowden for his action? Shmaiel Nona Burradoo, NSW, Australia â¢ The Beatles piece (1 November) will just nudge our memories. My first live concert at the Luton Odeon in September 1963: I heard nothing but saw all. Then the year after, I had a chance meeting at the airport with John, Cynthia, George and Pattie. Every LP was a mega-jump musically at that time. This band moved a generation as nothing will ever do. E Slack L'Isle Jourdain, France â¢ Regarding your story Arctic activists denied bail (25 October), an old Native American prophecy says: "There will come a time when the earth grows sick, and when it does a tribe will gather from all the cultures of the world who believe in deeds and not words. They will work to heal it ... they will be known as the Warriors of the Rainbow". Irmgard Clay Berlin, Germany â¢ As Suzanne Moore says (1 November), and we who ride buses can confirm, parents with "buggies as big as cars" not only crowd the pavements but the aisles too. Many of the children reclining in them, looking blissfully contented like pashas, are actually old enough to walk. We must assume that either they don't want to, or their parents have conveniently opted for the cart over the slower hand-in-hand. Richard Orlando Montreal, Canada â¢ While I enjoy your World roundup map on pages 2 and 3, I am disappointed that the paper, with its liberal world outlook, chooses to use the colonial-era Mercator projection. Africa is shrunk to the size of North America, and India is depicted scarcely larger than the British Isles. Wouldn't the Peters world map be more appropriate for the paper?

2.25pm AEST First question from Labor on Gonski. Pre-empting the education issue, Tony Abbott is listing the political crimes of the Labor party. Everywhere you look the former government has left a mess. Next comes a Shorten question on government's education promise. Then, foreign minister Julie Bishop is detailing Australian assistance for the typhoon relief effort in the Philippines.The Australian government is the fourth largest donor for disaster relief after the US, the UK and Japan. Everyday Australians have committed $9m. Tanya Plibersek asks about education funding and Abbott reads out a statement from NSW premier Barry O'Farrell commending the prime minister for restoring $1.2bn "deceitfully removed" by Labor. (State Liberals are talking to Federal Liberals again.) Joe Hockey gets a government question on the debt ceiling: "Labor will wear this". No mention of a crown of thorns. Labor's Kate Ellis asks about education funding promise. Bandt asks if the PM will institute an inquiry on intelligence gathering. Abbott makes three points: 1. Australian intelligence agencies will always act to protect national interest. 2. Security agencies operate under strict safeguards and scrutiny, including the joint parliarmentary committee and inspector general of intelligence. 3. We don't comment on intelligence gathering.

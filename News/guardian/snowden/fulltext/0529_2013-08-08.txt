In fact the body which would have to approve changes to the Editors' Code is the board of Ipso itself, not the RFC (Guardian group rejects industry plan for press self-regulator, 7 August, page 9). â¢ A story about Waitrose opening the first supermarket farm shop in the UK incorrectly asserted that the supermarket is "opening the shop amid widespread consumer doubts over its supply chain in the wake of the horsemeat scandal".

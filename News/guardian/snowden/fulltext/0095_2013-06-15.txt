Link to video: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden: 'I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things' As most of the world knows by now, 29-year-old Edward Snowden shared one of the biggest leaks of US intelligence documents and practices in American history. He said he did it because "my sole motive is to inform the public" and "I had been looking for leaders, but I realised that leadership is about being the first to act." By the time The Guardian made the National Security Agency files public, Snowden had relocated to Hong Kong, because he says he has "faith in Hong Kong's rule of law". The question now is what his next move should be. The United Kingdom has made it clear that it doesn't want Snowden within its borders. The UK instructed airlines to refuse to fly Snowden to the country. Other nations with close ties to the United States might follow suit. Snowden faces a delicate balance. He appears to want to remain free as long as possible and certainly should be concerned about his safety, but he also calls himself a real American and someone who wants to promote transparency and freedom. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has faced some criticism for his decision to hide out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, a nation that has a troubling free press record. So Snowden needs a place that is both unlikely to extradite or harm him and one that will not tarnish his record as a champion of freedom. Where would you go if you were in his position?

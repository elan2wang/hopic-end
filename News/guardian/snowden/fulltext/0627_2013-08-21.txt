Rather against the evidence, which seems pretty overwhelming, that the security services are not stupid, I'm beginning to conclude that the real reason behind the actions against David Miranda and the Guardian is actually a gross attempt at intimidation (Secrets and threats â why hard drives were smashed, 21 August). Even the personnel employed by the security services must have realised that Glenn Greenwald would not have kept only one copy of the Snowden data â much less that he would have let the one copy be taken on a plane. So the aim of the detention and the fatuous destruction of hard drives at the Guardian's offices was clearly other. I hope that next time these heavy-handed minions of the UK version of the Stasi descend on your offices, you tell them clearly and unequivocally where to go and where to stick their demands. Dr Richard Carter London â¢ Julian Borger's article reveals a British legal system with, at best, a confused legal protection of a free press acting in the public interest. This allows the UK state to act in ways that would be ruled unconstitutional under the first amendment of the US constitution, which enshrines freedom of the press. Having drafted a framework on privacy and the press which is widely accepted, Lord Justice Leveson should be asked to draft a legal framework which protects the press acting in the public interest. An alternative would be to have a law commission investigation and proposals for law reform. Jeremy Ross Ashstead, Surrey â¢ Indefensible incidents of censorship such as this tend only to get worse with time, not better. A true and open democracy cannot survive without a free exchange of ideas, an informed populace and the willingness of concerned citizens to speak out. The British public should demand answers as to how and why this incident occurred and work to ensure that Britain doesn't go down the slippery slope towards becoming a tyranny. Dr Michael Pravica Henderson, Nevada â¢ What to do with the destroyed computers? I suggest donating them to the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, where they already have some historic computers, and to the People's History Museum, so that the story of our oppressive regime will be there for posterity. Francis Treuherz London â¢ Maybe it's time for the BBC to rerun their prescient thriller series 1990, first broadcast in the 70s. Starring the great Edward Woodward and written by the equally great Wilfred Greatorex, it gave us a United Kingdom government which maintains control through censorship and surveillance. The press is neutered.The rule of law no longer protects the weak. And the borders are closed. We're only a few years behind schedule. Charles Harris London â¢ Theresa May has completely ruined my enjoyment of The Bourne Supremacy. I used to think that targeting Guardian reporters and listening to their phone calls was fiction. Now I find out that the movie is a documentary. John Loader Leyburn, North Yorkshire

"In terms of surveillance? Expanded [the programs] in volume, changed the legal grounding for them a little bit... and added a bit more oversight," Hayden said. • "White House 'welcomes media interest' in Prism," by Dan Roberts in the Guardian. "We welcome congressional interest in these issues, we welcome the interest of the American people and of course the media in these issues," says deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. • "This abuse of the Patriot Act must end," a Jim Sensenbrenner editorial in the Guardian. "I authored the Patriot Act, and this is an abuse of that law." • "Peeping Barry," Maureen Dowd's column in the New York Times. "Now that we are envisioning some guy in a National Security Agency warehouse in Fort Meade, Md., going through billions of cat videos and drunk-dialing records of teenagers, can the Ministries of Love and Truth be far behind?" • "U.S., company officials: Internet surveillance does not indiscriminately mine data," by Robert O'Harrow Jr., Ellen Nakashima and Barton Gellman in the Washington Post. "From their workstations anywhere in the world, government employees cleared for PRISM access may “task” the system and receive results from an Internet company without further interaction with the company’s staff."

Edward Snowden: now compared by Richard Cohen to American patriotic hero Paul Revere, and not Little Red Riding Hood. Photograph: Uncredited/AP Besotted fans of the regularly published Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen will know that he has reversed himself on whether Edward Snowden, the source of leaks about NSA surveillance activity in the United States and abroad, is a traitor. In June, Cohen wrote that Snowden would go down in history not as a whistleblower but "as a cross-dressing Little Red Riding Hood" who is "ridiculously cinematic" and "narcissistic". On Monday, Cohen retracted that view (although without returning specifically to the Little Red Riding Hood insight): As time has proved, my judgments were just plain wrong. Whatever Snowden is, he is curiously modest and has bent over backward to ensure that the information he has divulged has done as little damage as possible. As a "traitor", he lacks the requisite intent and menace [â¦] I am sure, though, that he has instigated a worthwhile debate. I am sure that police powers granted the government will be abused over time and that Snowden is an authentic whistleblower â¦ Not everyone believes that the ship of conventional wisdom begins a slow turn whenever the widely-distributed Cohen points in a new direction in his column. Me: As uninterested in Richard Cohen's opinion when I agree with it as I am when I don't. — emptywheel (@emptywheel) October 22, 2013 But maybe, the view on Snowden among members of the media that emerged in the immediate aftermath of his disclosures is changing. Here's what some of the country's other strongest pundits thought back then. Jeffrey Toobin wrote in the New Yorker that Snowden should have just taken his concerns to senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate committee on intelligence: For this, some, including my colleague John Cassidy, are hailing him as a hero and a whistle-blower. He is neither. He is, rather, a grandiose narcissist who deserves to be in prison [â¦] The American government, and its democracy, are flawed institutions. But our system offers legal options to disgruntled government employees and contractors. They can take advantage of federal whistle-blower laws; they can bring their complaints to Congress; they can try to protest within the institutions where they work. But Snowden did none of this. Instead, in an act that speaks more to his ego than his conscience, he threw the secrets he knew up in the air â and trusted, somehow, that good would come of it. We all now have to hope that he's right. Feinstein, incidentally, was one of several politicians on both sides of the aisle who did not hesitate to call Snowden a "traitor"; others included senator Harry Reid, House speaker John Boehner, and congressman Peter King. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo compared Snowden to Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning, whom Marshall thinks little of: Snowden seems to be who Manning's supporters always wanted to pretend he was but wasn't. It's only fair for me to say that, in my mind, they're fundamentally the same. The Guardian, in its promotion of this story is one of the "most significant leaks in US political history". I'm not sure that's necessarily true, though it's difficult to come up with other contenders. But by revealing so much and then revealing himself, I do think he's taken the story into a genuinely unprecedented place. Marshall was critical of Snowden for seeking to "evade the criminal consequences" of his actions and accused him of "defecting to China". Andrew Ross Sorkin said on CNBC he would "almost arrest" Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist to whom Edward Snowden first leaked NSA documents: He faces American espionage charges now after he admitted to revealing classified documents. I got to say, this is â I feel like, A, we've screwed this up to even let him get to Russia. B, clearly the Chinese hate us to even let him out of the country. That says something. Russia hated us and we knew that beforehand but that's sort of â and now, I don't know. And my second piece of this â¦ I would arrest him and now I'd almost arrest Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who seems to be out there, he wants to help him get to Ecuador. Sorkin later wrote to Greenwald on Twitter that "just to be 100% clear: i am not saying you or any journalists should be arrested." But David Gregory seemed to think that might be a good idea. The host of NBC's Meet the Press asked Greenwald: To the extent that you have aided and abetted Mr Snowden, even in his current moments, why shouldn't you, Mr Greenwald, be charged with a crime? Greenwald replied: I think it's pretty extraordinary that anybody who would call themself a journalist would publicly muse about whether or not other journalists should be charged with felonies. The assumption in your question, David, is completely without evidence. Not every journalist thought either Snowden or Greenwald or both should be immediately jailed. Some writers rose to eloquent defenses of Snowden's radical blow for transparency. Read, for example, Toobin's New Yorker colleague, John Cassidy: Having spent almost 18 years at the New Yorker, I'm arguably just as much a part of the media establishment as David Gregory and his guests. In this case, though, I'm with Snowden â not only for the reasons that Drake enumerated but also because of an old-fashioned and maybe naÃ¯ve inkling that journalists are meant to stick up for the underdog and irritate the powerful. On its side, the Obama administration has the courts, the intelligence services, Congress, the diplomatic service, much of the media, and most of the American public. Snowden's got Greenwald, a woman from WikiLeaks, and a dodgy travel document from Ecuador. Which side are you on? John Maynard Keynes famously said: When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir? So did the facts here change? Or have some people just changed their minds? And should we welcome that, when admitted, or should we hold them in some way accountable for getting it wrong in the first place?

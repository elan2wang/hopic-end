Andrew Parker (above), the director general of MI5, has explicitly criticised leaks from the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Photograph: MI5/PA On Tuesday the head of MI5 Andrew Parker gave a speech in which he mounted a robust defence of GCHQ and its surveillance methods. Though he didn't name Edward Snowden or the Guardian by name, he explicitly criticised recent leaks from the whistleblower. Here are the key extracts from the speech â along with the Guardian's analysis and context: 1. "We only apply intrusive tools and capabilities against terrorists and others threatening national security. The law requires we only collect and access information that we really need to perform our functions, in this case tackling the threat of terrorism." It is true that if MI5 wants to target an individual, or a group, then it has to seek a warrant from the home secretary. But what Snowden revealed is something quite different. In Tempora, GCHQ has a programme that is capable of sucking up vast amounts of personal data from the undersea cables that carry internet traffic in and out of the UK. That is not a narrow targeting capability. It gives the agency access to the private communications of millions of people. This is allowed under a little known section of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), which was brought in 13 years ago, long before Tempora was devised. GCHQ has relied on paragraph four of section 8  to gain "external warrants". In most Ripa cases, a minister has to be told the name of an individual or company being targeted before a warrant is granted. But section 8 permits GCHQ to perform sweeping and indiscriminate trawls of external data if a minister issues a certificate along with the warrant. According to the Snowden documents, the certificate allows GCHQ to search for material under a number of themes, including intelligence on the political intentions of foreign governments; military postures of foreign countries; terrorism, international drug trafficking and fraud. One briefing notes says such sweeping certificates "cover the entire range of GCHQ's intelligence production". The raw material is then recycled through machine-reading programmes which look for key words, names, phrases and patterns. 2. "In some quarters there seems to be a vague notion that we monitor everyone and all their communications â¦ utter nonsense." Nobody has ever claimed this is happening. But by exaggerating the point, Parker swerves around another truth â that the UK's intelligence agencies are already scooping up more material than ever before, and GCHQ has an ambition to go further. Documents seen by the Guardian described how the agency is seeking to "exploit any phone, anywhere, any time". Tempora already gives GCHQ the capacity to collect more than 21 petabytes of data a day â equivalent to sending all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours. In 2011, 350 British analysts and 200 from the NSA were sifting through the Tempora database. In the US, Snowden's files have disclosed how the simple "metadata" of every single call made within America is available to the intelligence services. It is not known whether Britain has the same capability. The intelligence agencies argue these tools are essential for tracking down terrorists. Privacy campaigners insist the scope and reach of these programmes goes beyond the reach of a set of outdated laws, and that the agencies are acting without a public mandate. 3. "It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will." This was the key soundbite of the speech â and it was provocative. But Parker did not provide any details to support the claim, nor can he. His view is the leaks have damaged national security, but the former director of operations and intelligence of MI6, Nigel Inkster, has been more sceptical. "I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told much they didn't already know or could have inferred." In an opinion piece for the New York Times, the security specialist Bruce Schneier said the argument about compromising national security "doesn't even pass the laugh test". Last week, the New York Times reported Snowden's disclosures had caused less damage than another self-inflicted leak. Apparently, there has been a "sharp drop in terrorists' use of a major communications channel" after the US press revealed American spies had intercepted messages between two senior al-Qaida commanders in the Middle East. 4. "Successive governments have made careful decisions about both the scale and powers of organisations like MI5, proportionate to the threats, and have gone no further. Britain is a democracy that rightly prizes the freedom of the individual." The three principal laws that set out the parameters for the intelligence agencies are the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, the Human Rights Act, and Ripa 2000. None of them could possibly have anticipated the technological advances that have been made in surveillance capabilities over the last few years. The former chair of parliament's intelligence and security committee, Lord King, has said it is high time these laws are reviewed and updated. The former director of GCHQ, Sir David Omand, and a former director general of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, have also questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work. None of them think the agencies have anything to fear by being a little more open and transparent. On Monday, a former legal director of MI5 and MI6, David Bickford, added his weight to the calls for change, saying the intelligence agencies should seek authority for secret operations from a judge rather than a minister because of public unease about their surveillance techniques is at an all-time high. 5. "Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm." Parker is upset about Snowden, but this is probably a veiled dig at the government too. The agencies have been frustrated that reporting of the Snowden files could not be shut down completely. For them, there is no public interest in revealing the scale of the programmes being undertaken. Tuesday night's speech was the result of months of pent up frustration, and it glossed over the fact the Guardian changed significant details in some of the stories at the request of officials from the Cabinet Office. The number of people "in the know" about Britain's surveillance capabilities seems to be very small indeed. Earlier this week the former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne said the Cabinet were kept in the dark. The National Security Council wasn't told either. Parker said MI5 could not stop every plot and neutralise every threat â which is true. But he has to be careful not to develop a narrative in which he is seen to be preemptively blaming whistleblowers for any future attacks.

Link to video: Lou Reed's shock at Edward Snowden's NSA revelations Lou Reed looked frail during his first public appearance after his liver transplant but his millions of fans could rest assured that the music legend remains as angry as ever, taking aim at digital music, journalists â and Barack Obama. Reed, appearing at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity on Thursday, said he was astonished by the NSA's surveillance programme revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. "It's so shocking," said Reed. "Obama of all people having that thing going on ... That's our guy who did that. It's very disturbing. A lot of the things [George W] Bush would have done, Obama has continued. How did that happen?" Reed said it was "beyond belief" that 29-year-old Snowden had access to the information and was able to release it. "Wow. Does that speak well for our security or what?" The 71-year-old singer said he took inspiration from world events and suggested the Snowden story might even provide the material for an album. "There are so many things in this world that are changing so quickly, everything is an inspiration," he said. "You could have an album about [Snowden]. Missing snow." Earlier, Reed criticised the quality of digital music, which he said "sounds like shit" and at the amount of money artists received for music downloads. He said CDs originally sounded "horrifying" compared to the "beautiful warm sound you get on vinyl". "MP3s for God's sake. A really miserable sounding thing, people don't understand what they are missing. It has been reduced to the lowest common denominator." He conceded that the ability to download had also had a positive effect, opening up the world's entire library of music. "Before you had to search things out. There it all is. But it sounds like shit. [Once you have found it] then you try to get a vinyl copy. You can get a good vinyl player for $400 or $500." But Reed said there was no money to be made from downloads, joking that he received a royalty cheque of $2.60 when he was 14 playing in a bar. "It's pretty much what I get from downloads now. I'm back where I started." Reed told the festival: "I understand young people were brought up on downloading and Steve Jobs tried to make it into some kind of business which benefits Apple but you get about a sixteenth of a penny. "You used to make a record but they reduced the size of it and put it in this plastic that breaks immediately, it's like, what? You realise they are really fucking with you, so people didn't want to pay for anything. "But meanwhile the musician doesn't get paid anything. Now making a record is kind of a promotional thing." Reed did not talk about his health following his life-saving liver transplant, beyond a reference to the passing of time and the fact he could not do the things he did as a younger man. "How could time go that quickly? It never ceases to amaze me. The other day I was 19, I could fall down and get back up. "Now if I fall down you are talking about nine months of physical therapy, make sure you take your vitamins. Is he OK?" Reed, renowned as a formidably tough interviewee, took aim at the "parasitical side" of journalists who were "very problematic. What they really want is something controversial". However, Reed spent 15 minutes answering questions from journalists after his festival appearance, even cracking the occasional joke. Though he did give short thrift to one reporter who asked how he stayed creative. "How do I stay creative? I masturbate every day. OK?" â¢ To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 3353 2000.

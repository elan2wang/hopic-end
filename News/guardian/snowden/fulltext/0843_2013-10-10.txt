It quoted Lon Snowden as saying his son would probably never return to the US: "I have no idea what [Edward's] intentions are but ever since he has been in Russia my understanding is that he has simply been trying to remain healthy and safe and he has nothing to do with future stories." He thanked Russia and President Vladimir Putin for sheltering his son. Edward Snowden was behind a leak of NSA material that allowed the Guardian and other media outlets to expose massive electronic surveillance by the US government and its allies. The 30-year-old systems analyst has been charged in federal court in Virginia with violations of the US espionage act.

So while the Washington Post, in the wake of the Guardian, pounds out stories from the Ed Snowden archive, Washington Post editorials call on the US government to stop leaks that "harm efforts to fight terrorism and conduct legitimate intelligence operations". Potty? Of course. But at least the old Post didn't tell Woodward and Bernstein to play the Star Spangled Banner.

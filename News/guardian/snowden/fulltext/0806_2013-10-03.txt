Former NSA and CIA chief Michael Hayden and Mike Rogers, chair of the house intelligence committee, have openly joked at the at the 2013 Cybersecurity Summit about putting Edward Snowden on a kill list. Brendan Sasso, a journalist with The Hill website, reported the exchange on Thursday. "I must admit, in my darker moment over the past several months, I'd also thought of nominating Mr. Snowden, but it was for a different list," Hayden said during a panel discussion on cybersecurity hosted by The Washington Post.  The audience laughed, and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who was also on the panel, responded, "I can help you with that."  Track #cybersec2013 on Twitter.

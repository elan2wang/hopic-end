As people consider the implications of the mass surveillance of their emails, here's an interesting historic parallel. In 1933, Hitler demanded that Germany's president, Hindenburg, sign what became known as the Reichstag fire decree (Reichstagsbrandverordnung). The decree is considered by historians to be one of the key steps in the establishment of a one-party Nazi state in Germany. It nullified many of the key civil liberties of German citizens, and it was used as the legal basis to imprison anyone considered to be opponents of the Nazis. It was also aimed at suppressing publications that were considered unfriendly to the Nazi cause. According to Ferdinand Schlingensiepen's biography of one of Hitler's leading critics, Dietrich Bonhoeffer*, the decree meant that "the right to privacy of communication by mail or telephone no longer existed." *Ferdinand Schlingensiepen, Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1906â1945: martyr, thinker, man of resistance (London, T&T Clarke, 2010) p.119

Badgers â¦ 'moving the goalposts', according to environment secretary Owen Paterson. Photograph: Tony Watson/Alamy Jonathan Heawood's support for the royal charter on press self-regulation (A charter for free speech, 9 October) is welcome, but he is in error when he writes that Hacked Off favours statutory regulation. We oppose statutory regulation and we believe it is essential that the regulatory system is free from political influence â as will be the case under the charter based on Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations. Brian Cathcart Executive director, Hacked Off â¢ With the prime minister now joining critics of the Guardian for publishing leaks from Edward Snowden (Report, 9 October), I feel compelled to defend your paper. As a rightwing republican admirer of the late Lady Thatcher, I also admire the courage of an editor prepared to publish the truth. Whatever Mr Snowden's motive, I was fascinated and alarmed at the revelation of the state's surveillance of ordinary individuals. It is incumbent for the Guardian to continue to take the lead in such matters.  Dominic Shelmerdine London â¢ Not content with badgering the poor over their feckless lack of funds, I see the government is now blaming the poor badgers ('The badgers are moving the goalposts', 10 October) for the failure of its cull. Yet another triumph of fantasy over reality for the non mea culpa culture of this caring coalition. Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire â¢ Presumably the two footballing badgers on the front page are part of a brock-solid defence. Derrick Cameron Stoke-on-Trent â¢ After watching the game at Anfield on Saturday, I'm in favour of a new-build Crystal Palace (Letters, 8 October). Michael Cunningham Wolverhampton â¢ Such timing! You print the recipe for the perfect plum cobbler on the very day we eat the last plum of the season from our tree (G2, 9 October). And we live in the north of England, so when the southerners finished theirs I can only guess at. Ah well, I'll have to cut it out and keep it for next year. Or you could reprint it next 1 September.

More revelations â¦a new book on Edward Snowden's revelations. Photograph: The Guardian/AFP/Getty Images Investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald is to publish a book about Edward Snowden's exposure of mass public surveillance by the US government. The book, which is due to be published in March, will contain new revelations about the NSA surveillance programs, according to publisher Metropolitan Books. It was bought by editor Sara Bershtel, who has a track record of publishing outspoken non-fiction writers with special insights into Washington's corridors of power. So far, no deal has been announced for UK publication. Metropolitan Books described the book as containing "new revelations exposing the extraordinary co-operation of private industry and the far-reaching consequences of the government's program, both domestically and abroad". Bershtel has previously edited the likes of Noam Chomsky, including his 2007 title Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy, and in January published Going to Tehran: Why the United States Must Come to Terms with the Islamic Republic of Iran by Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett, former analysts in the Bush and Clinton administrations. Greenwald, a regular columnist for the Guardian who worked as a constitutional and civil rights lawyer before going into journalism, has written four books focusing on the conduct and influence of the US state. His With Liberty and Justice for Some, published in the UK in 2012, charted abuses of power since Watergate, continuing through the 2008 financial crisis and ending with criticism of the Obama administration. In his 2008 book, A Tragic Legacy: How a Good Vs Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency, he reveals what he sees as the faulty ideals upon which George W Bush built his policies.

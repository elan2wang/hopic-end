Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA â¢ We worry about Ian Austin, the combative Labour member for Dudley. There he was just a few weeks back, making common cause with Conservatives on the home affairs select committee who would tar and feather the Guardian for the Edward Snowden revelations on government snooping. One had hoped it was an aberration. But today there he was again, one of those swiping at PJ Harvey's guest editorship on the Today programme, which featured our own Ian Cobain revealing titbits about Britain's complicity in acts of torture. Austin particularly disliked Harvey's inclusion of Mr WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who â from his lair at the Ecuadorean embassy used a Thought for the Day slot to condemn attempts by US and UK governments to acquire a "god-like" knowledge of citizens through mass surveillance. Doesn't seem an outlandish stance to take, whatever one thinks of Assange. If it continues like this, people might start assuming that Austin has no great objection to snooping and secrecy by such as GCHQ and the NSA. â¢ They seek it here, they seek it there. They seek the mass invasion of Romanians and Bulgarians everywhere. But, as common sense might have told them, it was never likely to happen like that, if it happened at all. It is worth saying that a few wise heads within the government, mostly Lib Dems, tried to damp down the hysteria; but the hotheads were convinced, and such as PM Dave seemed to sign up to the Henny Penny moment that gripped the nation. One wonders what body of research the doomsters were relying on. There's a government quango called the migration advisory committee to provide considered info and expert guidance, and often it does just that. But a peek at its website shows it hasn't been updated for months, and no minutes for meetings have been posted since the summer. Wags suggest its work may one day be outsourced to MigrationWatch UK. That couldn't happen, could it? â¢ Not a great deal about Europe in PM Dave's new year address. By contrast, there was a distinctly European flavour to the new year message from FranÃ§ois Hollande, to compatriots who have rather cooled on him. Watch this space, said Hollande, for he "and Germany" will be proposing initiatives to "strengthen" the EU in the spring. He also had harsh words for those preaching "austerity and a retreat behind national borders". Who does that bring to mind? Could be the year of the European cold shoulder for Dave. â¢ Definitely the year of the cold shoulder for many in the Socialist Workers party, now riven by vastly more factions than is traditional or necessary. It was hoped that the party conference last month would heal the divisions caused by the leadership's shocking handling of abuse allegations raised by two female members. But if anything, matters have deteriorated, and we learn that possibly 200 have since relinquished their membership. A number posted a joint letter of resignation before Christmas. "We have resigned because the leadership failed to put our principles on women's liberation into practice," they said. A good deal more had already drifted away in the months before. They promised to remain supportive, but at this rate the Socialist Workers party risks becoming the Socialist Worker's party. Still, if it does dwindle to a single member at least he won't be able to fall out with himself. â¢ Finally, it was a difficult 2013 for Barack Obama, plagued by budget problems and a fiasco over Obamacare. And there's no obvious sign that his critics will give him a break. One of the louder, wilder detractors appears to be Jim Garrow, a favourite of the rightwing radio talkshow circuit and a "birther" â one who maintains that the president is a foreign citizen. Garrow has already warned that Obama may resort to nuclear attacks on US cities. Now he says he will seek to bolster his falling ratings by revealing that his administration is in direct communication with extraterrestrials. The disclosure prompted concerned discussion on a programme presented by Fox News contributor Erik Rush."Wow," said Rush. "Personally I've already heard some other sources saying the very same thing that you're saying," added Tea Party commentator Nancy Smith. Can't see them giving Obama the benefit of the doubt, can you? Twitter: @hugh_muir

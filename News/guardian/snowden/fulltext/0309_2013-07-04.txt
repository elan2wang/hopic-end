Nick Rennison borrows from Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes novels, in his book, Carver's Quest. Photograph: Hulton Getty Critic Nick Rennison is a Sherlock Holmes expert with a special interest in the copycat sleuths who sprang up in his wake. So it is no surprise to find him pastiching Conan Doyle in Carver's Quest (Corvus, Â£12.99), the first of a projected series starring amateur archaeologist Adam Carver and his runtish manservant Quint. It's entertaining stuff â knowing, but never too knowing â and Rennison's love of Victorian slang reflects a broader linguistic flair. But the novel's shaggy-dog linearity and air of having been written off the top of Rennison's head merely underline Doyle's punchy concision, arguably the quality that has stopped the Holmes stories from dating as they might have done. Mark Mills's historical thrillers have been commercial as well as critical hits: The Savage Garden, set in Italy in the late 1950s, was a Richard & Judy bestseller in 2006. He has switched publisher for The Long Shadow (Headline Review, Â£14.99), his first contemporary novel. Its hero is Ben, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter whose life is transformed when a film company options one of his scripts. The company, it transpires, is the plaything of Jacob, a friend from boarding school who lived with Ben's family during the holidays. Jacob is now a hedge-fund billionaire who has renamed himself Victor to distance himself from the parents he no longer sees. At Victor's invitation, Ben moves into his country pile to polish the script. But Victor is a sociopath: a puppet-master with a grudge, whose generosity, Ben discovers, is weapons-grade. Mills is an able storyteller and the premise is terrific, so it's a shame that The Long Shadow never shocks as it should. It's too in love with the surface details of Victor's spendthrift life to worry about pace, and the romance Mills constructs for Ben is icky beyond belief. The Twelfth Department (Mantle, Â£16.99) is the third of William Ryan's Captain Korolev novels set in 1930s Stalinist Russia. A police officer with the Moscow militia, Korolev is supposed to have a week off while his son Yuri is staying with him. Instead, he is hauled in to investigate the murder of an eminent scientist, then dropped from the case, then requisitioned by state security, where he is caught awkwardly between competing factions. Yuri, meanwhile, goes missing, and when Korolev discovers who has been holding him captive it makes matters even more complicated. Ryan's tense, tightly plotted whodunnits feel gloriously plausible, a function of the intimate link he forges between his readers and his characters, never mind that those characters are living through extraordinary times. The older ones, such as Korolev, are cynical, though wary even of their own children. There is a poignant moment when Korolev takes earnest Yuri to the zoo and tries not to laugh (because what would Yuri think?) as they are shown around an area "devoted to the animals that underpin the fur industry â so that we can demonstrate nature within its socialist and industrial context". Arne Dahl's Intercrime novels have been adapted for TV with great success â so much so that fans may not want to bother with the source books, which, if Rachel Willson-Broyles's new English translation of Bad Blood (Harvill Secker, Â£14.99), the second in the series, is anything to go by, aren't as good. Sweden's intercrime department or "A-Unit", specialising in "violent crimes of an international character", is on the verge of being wound down. But then a serial killer, having finished off a literary critic in a janitor's closet at Newark airport, flies to Sweden using his victim's plane ticket. His trademark torture method, pioneered in Vietnam, is so horrific I can't bring myself to describe it. The geopolitical disenchantment that drives the plot is compelling. It's just a shame that so much of Bad Blood reads as if it has been run through Google Translate. My favourite: "His students were like lit light-bulbs in front of the horribly expanding diagram on the whiteboard." A more thoughtful take on serial killing is David Thomas's Ostland (Quercus, Â£16.99), based on the true story of Georg Heuser, a young German detective who, in February 1941, helped to find the perpetrator of some horrific slaughters on Berlin's S-Bahn trains. Heuser was himself arrested for murder nearly 20 years later. With subtlety and intelligence, Thomas joins the historical dots to produce a novel with plenty to say â eloquently â about the brutalising effects of the Holocaust. Jeffrey Deaver's 10th thriller featuring quadriplegic criminologist Lincoln Rhyme and sidekick Amelia Sachs, is The Kill Room (Hodder, Â£18.99). It combines an intricate understanding of the post-private world of Edward Snowden (who could easily be a character from a Deaver novel) and drone strikes on US citizens with expert pacing and strong characterisation. As with all the best series novels, you can drop in at any point and feel at home.

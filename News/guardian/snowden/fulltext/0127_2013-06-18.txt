â¢ We confused father and son US Republican politicians in a Comment piece (The whistleblowers: a new generation of US patriots, 17 June, page 27). Edward Snowden gave money to Ron Paul's presidential campaign, not to Rand Paul. Paul Sr is regarded as the intellectual godfather of the Tea Party movement and ran for the US presidency three times. His son, Rand, became a Republican senator for Kentucky in 2010. â¢ A note at the end of Rahila Gupta's article (The ballad of my son's struggle, 18 June, page 12, G2) gave the wrong information for her show Don't Wake Me: The Ballad of Nihal Armstrong. We stated that it was starting on 22 June at the Cockpit Theatre, London. It has already opened and was reviewed on 7 June by Michael Billington; the other details were correct. â¢ Our Pass Notes on morris dancers (17 June, page 3, G2) and the shortage of irons failed to distinguish between two traditions of the dance. The picture showed dancers in Worcestershire who were wearing bells but not clogs. The custom of wearing irons on the soles of clogs is from the north-west of England and the "clack, clack, clack" mentioned in the article comes from these rather than bells on dancers' legs. â¢ NSA surveillance: what Germany could teach the US was amended because it wrongly stated that German chancellor Angela Merkel was born in East Germany. She was born in Hamburg, then in West Germany, but was raised in the East.

Your report of last week's parliamentary debate on oversight of the intelligence services (1 November) did not mention the role of the interception of communications commissioner. He is responsible for oversight of all electronic surveillance under Part One of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. In the debate I raised the problem of the very low profile of this role and asked two questions which would be of particular interest to the Guardian and its readers. First, we know from a letter to the Independent that the commissioner is carrying out an investigation into the Edward Snowden leaks. In relation to Tempora, I asked for an assurance that the commissioner would be given full access to all the surveillance information undertaken as part of Tempora, including that acquired from our allies. Second, I asked whether a special report will be compiled by the commissioner and if so for a timetable. The last commissioner's report covering 2012 was only published in July 2013. I believe that it is important that we have a timely report on this matter. I did not receive answers from the minister in the debate and so have now written to him asking the same questions once again. Diana Johnson MP Shadow crime and security minister

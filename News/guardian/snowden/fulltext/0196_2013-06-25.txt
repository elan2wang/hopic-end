â¢ A column by George Monbiot about undercover policing and the revelations of CIA intelligence analyst Edward Snowden (How can we invest our trust in a state that spies on us?, 25 June, page 29) said that former Home Office minister Nick Herbert stated in parliament that it was "acceptable for police officers to have sex with activists, for the sake of their 'plausibility'." He did not. That was an inference taken from his contribution to a debate about the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), in which he said: "In a very limited range of circumstances, an authorisation under Ripa part II may render lawful conduct that would otherwise be criminal, if it is incidental to any conduct falling with the Act that the source is authorised to take." On the specific issue of sexual relations between undercover officers and members of groups they were attempting to infiltrate, Herbert said: "The Ripa statutory guidance does not explicitly cover the matter of sexual relationships, but it does make it clear that close management and control should be exercised by the undercover officer's management team." The word "plausibility" was not used in the debate. â¢ Readers thought they had caught out our columnist known as the secret actor (The ka-ka-ka method of reciting Shakespeare, 24 June, G2, page 19). If the actor being lampooned in the column had been speaking in pure iambic pentameter, he ought to have said "ka" only 20 times, not 22. The error was the pompous Bardmeister's, not our columnist's. â¢ Police cells holding more than 9,000 mentally ill people a year was corrected because the original referred to the "1984 Mental Health Act", when it should have said 1983. â¢ We hate to be called a food bank was corrected to give the correct name of the venue for Doncaster's Balby Bridge food bank as St James's church hall, not St Stephen's as the original said.

Good to meet you â¦ Yahia Lababidi Growing up in Egypt, reading the Guardian was a kind of badge of honour. It meant you were cultured and sophisticated enough not to fall for shoddy or sensationalist journalism. Living in America for the last seven years has only deepened my admiration for your paper. It helps dim the din of the dubious talking heads on television, and tune out the alarmist propaganda in many of the local papers. As a writer, your books section continues to serve as an education and source of sustenance. After Egypt's revolution, wrestling with what the role of the literary artist might be in times of crises, I was proud to read the passionate yet measured commentary by compatriot and fellow writer Ahdaf Soueif. With the ongoing unravelling madness, I often direct bewildered acquaintances to your website for more thoughtful, balanced perspectives on Egypt, and the Middle East. Then there was Glenn Greenwald's noble coverage of the NSA scandal. When the unquestioning US press set out to defame Edward Snowden, and by association Greenwald, my loyalties to the Guardian deepened. In this stance I saw the journalist as moral watchdog. Like Snowden, I regarded Greenwald as a man of conscience, possessed by the courage of his convictions. In these morally muddled times, it is good to be reminded of our larger loyalties to truth and one another. Thank you for being there!

9.45am GMT Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world, as controversy over revelations leaked by the whistleblower continue to make headlines. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about – and any new areas you'd like to read more about. Good morning. Here are today’s key developments: • A survey in the US has shown many people have formed mistaken impressions about what the NSA does and does not do, the Washington Post reports. â Thirty-nine percent of those questioned believe that the NSA’s bulk collection of all US telephone records — the 215 metadata program — includes listening in to the contents of those calls. In fact, the NSA collects data on the numbers dialed and the length of calls, not their content. â Almost one-third “believe NSA conducts operations to capture or kill foreign terrorists and another 39 percent were not sure.” The agency doesn’t do either. â The poll also found that “35 percent believe NSA interrogates detainees and another 42 percent were not sure.” The NSA does not conduct interrogations. The survey also showed that those who watched spy films and TV programmes seemed to approve of the NSA more than those who didn’t. â A majority of people who in the past year watched at least six spy movies “had favorable views of NSA, but only 34 percent of infrequent spy moviegoers reported favorable views of the agency,” according to the poll. â Forty-four percent of those who watched spy-themed TV shows frequently or occasionally approved of the NSA programs that collected telephone records and Internet data. By comparison, 29 percent of those who rarely watched such shows approved of the surveillance. â When it came to whether NSA officials were being honest when they said the agency did not listen to phone calls as part of its metadata collection, 23 percent of frequent or occasional watchers of spy-focused TV shows were believers, while 15 percent of infrequent watchers thought officials were telling the truth. • Senator John McCain has called for Keith Alexander to "resign or be fired" as the head of the National Security Agency, in an interview with the German news weekly Der Spiegel published on Sunday. The senator for Arizona, a former Republican presidential candidate, said Alexander should be held accountable for the leaks of thousands of documents by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, which revealed NSA surveillance and spying on a massive scale. McCain said Snowden, who worked for the NSA as a contractor, should never have had access to classified information. "And now we have a contractor employee, not a government employee, who has access to information which is, when revealed, most damaging to the standing prestige of the United States and our relations with some of our best friends," McCain said. "Why did Edward Snowden have that information? And what are we doing as far as screening people who have access to this information? It's outrageous, and someone ought to be held accountable." President Barack Obama, the NSA and the congressional intelligence committee had responsibility for the sharing of classified information, he said. Asked if Alexander should resign, McCain said: "Of course, he should resign, or be fired. We no longer hold anybody accountable in Washington." • The Guardian faced fresh criticism from the government over its handling of leaks from former NSA analyst Edward Snowden as two cabinet ministers said its revelations had endangered national security. William Hague, the foreign secretary, and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, endorsed comments made at the recent intelligence and security committee hearing at which Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, said Britain's enemies were "rubbing their hands with glee" over the disclosures. But despite the former defence secretary Liam Fox writing to the Crown Prosecution Service asking whether there is a case for legal action against the Guardian, the two ministers sidestepped questions about whether they would like to see a prosecution. "Action against any particular media outlet in any particular country, unfortunately, is not going to reverse the damage that has been done," Hammond said on Sunday. Speaking on Sky News, he said: "Have the Snowden revelations damaged our ability to fight terrorism and keep Britain safe? Undoubtedly they have. Anything that gives away the tradecraft, the methods, the methodologies of the security services and the agencies is, of course, hugely valuable to those who wish us harm." Hague, who oversees the work of MI6, spoke in similar terms when interviewed on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Everything he had seen suggested that what the intelligence chiefs said about the Guardian revelations was "absolutely right", he said. • The editor of the Guardian is to be questioned by MPs about this newspaper's publication of intelligence files leaked by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden. Alan Rusbridger is to appear before the House of Commons home affairs select committee next month following warnings from British security chiefs that the revelations were damaging national security. "Alan has been invited to give evidence to the home affairs select committee and looks forward to appearing next month," a Guardian spokeswoman said. The heads of MI6, MI5 and GCHQ claim terrorist groups are changing their operations as a result of the leaks. • A Conservative peer and former cabinet minister has attacked the UK media's "lackadaisical" response to the US whistleblower Edward Snowden and called on "defenders of liberty" to speak out against invasion of personal freedoms by the intelligence services. The former Tory party chairman John Gummer, now Lord Deben, said the revelations should be a cause for concern "from right to left" as spying agencies too easily use terrorism as an excuse to invade civil liberties … Deben said the UK had a "duty of guardianship" to its citizens and warned it was dangerous to accept the word of the intelligence agencies. "If you look back into history, the times at which people lose their freedoms are always times when the loss of freedom is excused by national emergency or by the need to fight terrorism," he said. "It means that whenever that's the argument used, people who believe in freedom should be extremely quick to stand up. "I am very surprised at the way in which the press in Britain has been so lackadaisical and not seen that there are issues here of huge importance. At a time when the majority of the press are making a great deal of fuss about what they see to be a threat to press freedom, here is an issue of freedom that I'm very surprised they have not caught on to and recognised. Who guards the guardians? It's absolutely crucial. This is the moment in which it should have been an issue from right to left." I'll have coverage of all major developments here throughout the day.

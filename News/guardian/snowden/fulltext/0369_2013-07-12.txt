The Daily Star was the only tabloid to lift its sales in June in an otherwise flat month in the daily national newspaper market. Richard Desmond's red-top increased its daily average circulation by 1.13%, to 540,849, as sales of all rival tabloids fell compared with May. There is little obvious reason for the resurgence in sales of the Daily Star, which began in April, with no reduction in its 35p cover price which its front page boasts is "15p cheaper than the Mirror". Last month the paper provided plenty of coverage of the latest series of Big Brother, which launched on Desmond-owned Channel 5 on 13 June. The Sun reported a daily circulation of 2,243,903 in June, a slip of 1.12% on the previous month. Sales of the Daily Mirror fell slightly by 0.24% compared with May, to 1,038,753. In the broadsheet market, the Independent edged closer to falling under 70,000 daily sales as it recorded a 2.70% circulation decline. Plans to increase its cover price by 20p, to Â£1.40, from Monday are expected to see Evgeny Lebedev's title drop under the 70,000 mark for the first time in July. There was better news for the Russian propietor's cut-price daily, i, which maintained 303,009 daily average sales despite a month-on-month drop of 1.16%. The Guardian shed 2.79% of its daily circulation compared with May with 187,000 recorded sales in June, when it broke a series of exclusives based on information provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. News UK's the Times had an average daily circulation of 390,941 in June, down 1.02% compared with May.

11.00am ET Mueller contends that phone records collection is somehow innocuous because the database includes only metadata and "has no content whatsoever." Metadata however can be more revealing, its collection more intrusive, than "content," Jane Mayer and others have argued. Then Mueller says telephony data collection might have stopped the 9/11 attacks. His argument turns on the story of Khalid al-Midhar, one of the hijackers of the plane that flew into the Pentagon. NSA director Keith Alexander made a similar case Wednesday. Intelligence agencies had been tracking Midhar overseas but lost him, Mueller said. They also identified an al-Qaeda safe house in Yemen but they didn't know who was calling it. Afterwards, Mueller says, the FBI figured out it was Midhar who called the Yemen safe house from San Diego. "If we had the telephone number in Yemen, we would have matched it up to that number in San Diego... and identified Midhar," Mueller says. The contention being that once having flagged Midhar, law enforcement could have seen, if it had an archived database of all phone calls, that he had been talking to 18 other potential suspects, and law enforcement might have realized there was a wider plot afoot. "If we had this program, the opportunity would have been there." The speculative argument has been used before, including by former director of national intelligence Michael Hayden to justify warrantless wiretapping when it was illegal during the Bush administration. "No one ever says that CIA sharing with FBI would have [worked] more quickly," Marcy Wheeler has pointed out. Updated at 11.26am ET

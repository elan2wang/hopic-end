Visions of tomorrow â¦ Dave Eggers. Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex Features "Bridget Jones was the poster girl for a generation â¦ I loved her like a soul sister." So began Sarah Crompton's review of Helen Fielding's Mad About the Boy in the Daily Telegraph, and you sensed that bad things were round the corner. Sure enough: "Fielding takes the staples of modern life â remote controls, tweeting, texting, online dating â and strains to make anything of them â¦ the tone is all wrong. Reading the first two thirds of Mad About the Boy is like listening to someone who once had perfect pitch, but now can't sing a note â¦ Every line feels full of effort â¦ as Bridget might say, v disappointing." The Sunday Times's Christina Patterson agreed: "It isn't just the style that jars: the random capital letters, the subjectless sentences, the mannerisms that now seem awfully tired. It isn't just the rather hysterical tone. It isn't even the pile-up of cliches â¦ It's the fact that I hardly believed a word of it â¦ Even brands have to feel authentic. And this one, very sadly for those of us who loved it, seems to have lost its shine." Isabel Berwick in the FT was rather isolated among reviewers in still finding Bridget "laugh-out-loud funny â¦ It is through Bridget's re-entry into the world of dating and sex that Fielding's book works best." Malcolm Gladwell is another much-loved author whose new book has been deemed disappointing. Matthew Syed in the Times was decidedly of this view, even though he "had been looking forward to David and Goliath ever since rumours started circulating that the undisputed king of "big ideas" books was working on a new one." The problem is that, in his manifesto for the underdog, "Gladwell fails to give us a rounded perspective â¦ As the book progresses the examples get less convincing â¦ this is by far his weakest book." According to Camilla Cavendish in the Sunday Times, reading Gladwell "is rather like dropping in on a conversation between clever, amiable people at some Ivy League cafe", but when this "book ended, I couldn't help feeling that Gladwell hadn't finished the conversation â he was just having it somewhere else." William Leith in the Spectator, on the other hand, found no fault with the "cornucopia of underdog-related stuff" expressed in "a wonderfully clear prose style". "Dave Eggers' latest book is set in the near future â very near, like tomorrow. The technology employed by The Circle â Google, Apple and Facebook all rolled into an ostensibly benevolent amalgam â is either available now or could be in the works." Lionel Shriver in the FT wondered if the subject matter explains why The Circle "seems so hurried â¦ The novel's wariness of the scale of surveillance now possible â¦ resonates with current affairs â Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks. But â¦ it feels slapdash. There's not a lot of terrible writing here; there just isn't much good writing â¦ Eggers is usually better than this." Stuart Kelly in The Scotsman was more positive: "Although the concerns of the novel are signalled fairly blatantly, Eggers still manages to pull some surprises. The ending is truly shocking. The Circle is intelligent and quirky, engaged and affecting and confirms Eggers' place as one of the most interesting novelists currently writing." Edmund Gordon in the Sunday Times argued that the "prose is easy flowing, but never very exciting â¦ The tone is also dizzyingly inconsistent â¦ But in spite of all this, it is a gripping and highly unsettling read. It paints a horrifying picture, in minute detail, of a future we'll be lucky to avoid."

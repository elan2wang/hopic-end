10.19am BST OK, let's recap on this morning's events. • Royal Mail has made a spectacular debut on the London Stock Market. Shares in the privatised postal operator surged by 35% the instant trading began, hitting 456p before settling around 445p. • This means an instant profit of around £250 for hundreds of thousands of people who bought £750 of shares in the hugely oversubscribed application process. • Had the government sold at 450p, not 330p, it would have raised more than £700m more for the taxpayer. • At this morning's share price, Royal Mail is worth around £4.5bn, not the £3.3bn the government's advisors estimated. This puts it on track to enter the FTSE 100 index. • Business secretary Vince Cable has already faced accusations that the government mishandled the IPO by selling shares far too cheaply. Cable told the Today Programme that the price should settle down, and insisted: This is a very good deal for shareholders, the government and the country, he insists. He later told Sky News that "spivs and speculators" shouldn't distract from the important job of putting Royal Mail on a sound commercial footing. • Over 100 million shares in Royal Mail changed hands in the first couple of hours, as investors raced to take a stake. Many trades were for 227 shares, the amount bought by small investors in the float. • One brokers website crashed under the demand.

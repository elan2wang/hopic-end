A mischievous comedian of Bea Lillie's vintage would surely have enjoyed Chas Brewster's fancifully confused suggestion (Letters, 10 June) that audiences kept applauding every time she spoke on stage when appearing in The Amorous Prawn at the Piccadilly theatre in the late 1960s. Lillie did not appear in The Amorous Prawn â which starred Evelyn Laye at the Saville a decade earlier. Lillie's last London play was Auntie Mame â not at the Piccadilly but at the Aldephi; not in the late 1960s but in 1958. Is there anyone left alive to confirm Brewster's assertion that the audience (which and when?) went obstructively wild over Lillie? Nicholas de Jongh London â¢âIt is scarcely surprising that the Berliner Ensemble is reluctant to keep staging Rolf Hochhuth's The Deputy, performed here as The Representative (Brecht's Berlin theatre company faces eviction, 10 June). It would easily get into my top 10 list of the most boring plays I ever saw in my life. Michael Bath Rochester, Kent â¢âAside from the novels, Iain Banks (Obituary, 10 June) must surely be remembered for his letters to the Guardian, particularly as the head of the London magazine Time Out reveals that it has scrapped its letters page (Media, 10 June). No good will come of that. Keith Flett London â¢âI notice that no one comes from anywhere these days; they "hail", as in Boards of Canada "hailing from rural Scotland" ('We've become a lot more nihilistic', G2, 7 June; Letters, 10 June). Copland Smith Chorlton cum Hardy, Manchester â¢âSo our "cherished photos" panned out at four dads, one grandad, one son and a pic of the Yorkshire Dales (Picture perfect, G2, 10 June). Something to be said about the Page 3 girls after all. Geraldine Monk Sheffield â¢âWould the Nobel committee consider withdrawing the peace award from Barack Obama and honouring Edward Snowden instead (The whistleblower, 10 June)? Ann Black Oxford

The digital bill of rights called for by prominent authors and a technologist's Hippocratic oath (Whose side are you on?, 10 December) are highly desirable. But your exposure of the threat (NSA and GCHQ target online gamers, 10 December) is a reminder that children need special protection. What about an internet age of consent, below which it is illegal for individuals, corporations or state agencies to hack, harvest or pass on for any other purposes a child's digital identity or contact details? At the same time, a mantra as concise and widely taught as the Green Cross Code â it could perhaps be called the Snowden Code â should be agreed to keep children from endangering their own privacy and safety on the internet. In the 21st century, the combination of surveillance, corporate power and cyber crime make going online as risky to personal safety as crossing the road. We all struggle to keep up, but below a certain age special protection is necessary. Richard Stainton Whitstable, Kent â¢ The internet has rarely been out of the news this year. Writers calling for a UN digital charter, child pornography, cyber terrorism and theft, rural broadband coverage, open internet standards, privacy, spam, net neutrality etc. In the 1930s, one man, Rex Leeper, was involved in the creation the British Council and the BBC World Service. These two organisations are our greatest instruments of soft power. It's time for UK plc to replicate Leeper and to create a world internet policy and research institute which puts the citizen at its heart. Derek Wyatt Labour MP 1997-2010; founder, parliamentary internet group â¢ I took the trouble to re-watch the session of the home affairs select committee taking evidence from your editor, Alan Rusbridger. Although my background is skewed towards being cautious of anyone accused of leaking secrets, I thought Mr Rusbridger's evidence was a virtuoso performance. In stressing the original motives of Edward Snowden, I do not expect any criminal charges. I believe the Guardian has done its best to do the right thing.

Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) watches as tourists, the lifeblood of the capital, begin to circulate in earnest again. Here's Paul (and be sure to stay for the kicker): The buzz of Washington activity was quickly resurrected on Thursday morning, as tourists, deprived of some of the country's best known sights, flocked to the reopened destinations. Not all the sights were open. The National Zoo and National Archives were both closed until Friday and The National Gallery of Art was going to open Saturday. But the monuments that line Washington's National Mall were bustling with tourists, as maintenance workers hastily tended to the overgrown grass - six-inches long in places. Almost all of the sightseers said they had pre-booked flights which they were unable to change; many had resigned themselves to a trip to Washington consisting of shopping and viewing buildings from the outside. Gene Hall, 82, one of 32 Korean War veterans from Missouri and Illinois, said his group had been told to brace themselves for the possibility they would only see one or two memorials. "I think it was ridiculous," he said of the shutdown. "I vote Republican but I am a moderate and I think what has gone on has been political." Stood nearby on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Shen Ling, 29, a teacher from China, said she and her friends heard the news that the shutdown was over in Chicago airport, just as they were about to board their flight. "We had prepared for the worst," she said. "And then were were all saying: 'wow.' Another Chinese tourist, on the national mall with his fiance, said he had not followed the politics of the fiscal crisis closely. "But this is what happens when you have two parties," he quipped. "One party is better."

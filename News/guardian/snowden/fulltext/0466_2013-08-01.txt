Photograph: The Guardian/Reuters National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has been granted asylum in Russia and left the Moscow airport where he had been stranded for more than a month, according to his Russian lawyer. Anatoly Kucherena said Snowden was issued papers that allowed him to leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where he had been stuck since his arrival from Hong Kong on 23 June, according to Reuters. "I have just seen him off. He has left for a secure location," Kucherena told state broadcaster Russia 24. "Security is a very serious matter for him." Reports in Russia said Snowden had been granted temporary asylum for one year. According to the Associated Press, Kucherena said Snowden had accepted a condition laid down by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to stop leaking US secrets in return for asylum. The US has been seeking Snowden's extradition to face felony charges for leaking details of NSA surveillance programmes. Snowden was stranded in the Moscow airport transit zone, which is technically not Russian territory, on 23 June, after US authorities annulled his passport while he was travelling from Hong Kong. Presidents Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin reportedly discussed the issue during a phone call in mid-July. Snowden's stay in Russia has strained relations between the two countries, with Obama reportedly reconsidering a visit planned for this autumn.

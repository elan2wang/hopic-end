Smidgen of statutory underpinning: Lord Justice Leveson and his report. Photograph: Graeme Robertson New and perplexed readers start here. There is a voluntary royal charter in place for future press regulation, one backed by all three major parties in parliament. It was signed off at the privy council last Wednesday. But the business of printing it on vellum and then constructing the "recognition committee" that will oversee the whole process is grindingly slow. It won't be complete until after the next election, even if the press is minded to join in, which currently it isn't. Newspapers and magazines, meanwhile, are busy setting up their alternative, non-charter regulator called the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which should commence operations in the spring of 2014. It may or may not come to command public approval. It may or may not be swept aside by an incoming government and replaced by involuntary legislation. For the moment, though, this is an archetypal no-score draw. Nobody â not the press, politicians or pressure groups â wins. Blame for this fragile state of affairs may be widely shared. Perhaps David Cameron, struggling to secure all-party support for a solution, spent too much time negotiating with Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg and not enough time securing press partnerships. Perhaps Hacked Off overplayed its hand. Perhaps newspapers fought too strident and internally conflicted a campaign, failing to convince the public, let alone the politicians, they were serious. And perhaps Lord Justice Leveson's unwillingness to go beyond his report and actually suggest ways of fulfilling its objectives as the debate floundered back and forth left a vacuum that politicking couldn't fill. None of this matters today. The plain fact, even before Leveson began his deliberations, was that the Press Complaints Commission is a busted flush. Phone hacking and adjacent events have broken its authority. It is good at resolving complaints but not at monitoring or enforcing good behaviour. If press regulation must be reinforced, as opposed to left to the criminal law, then a new body able to investigate and set standards of editorial conduct is required. There is no real argument about that. The immediate challenge for all sides is to rediscover that bedrock consensus. If we need more proactive, more durable press regulation, then how do we achieve it? Waking up in May 2015, after the next election, to find the old PCC still marking time would be shared failure.  One difficulty, however, is that the royal charter formula, dreamed up in the Cabinet Office as a less obviously onerous alternative to Leveson's smidgen of statutory underpinning, is a wheeze that has blighted rather than boosted progress. The editor-in-chief of the Guardian and Observer called it a "medieval nonsense". The Independent and Financial Times seem no more enthusiastic. If papers such as these aren't on board then the confection simply isn't fit for purpose: too rigid, too archaic in its rituals, too open to political interference just behind the arras. Vellum or no vellum, there is no realistic prospect of this particular charter winning press acceptance now or in the future. It's a dud idea and one that amplifies the weaknesses in Sir Brian Leveson's approach. Its appendix detailing who and who isn't a "relevant publisher" within its ambit is quill-pen stuff in an era of sweeping digital change. Its aura, unsurprisingly, is relentlessly legalistic, written by lawyers for lawyers, criss-crossed by the audit trails judges love to follow. We can, perhaps, see where such preoccupations lead at the Old Bailey over the next six months. But the news since Leveson put away his laptop has been wholly different: the giant invasions of privacy practised by America's National Security Agency and its pliant partners.  Some of these same objections, to be sure, are there as Ipso begins to take shape. It, too, has been fashioned by lawyers, audit trails awinding (and former presidents of the supreme court presiding over recognition tasks). But at least there's no vellum on display, at least there is the flexible possibility of adjusting its practical reach as the digital revolution sweeps on. If phone hacking was a last decade phenomenon, the present decade looks utterly different. But will Ipso, once up and running, be able to win public approval? Can it possibly break the impasse? The press can't be sanguine here. It hasn't won the public argument. It has not managed to get three influential national newspaper groups (including this one) on board. The background of trials and arrests is awful. A foreground of ritual snipings and snarlings between papers does not help, either. Press freedom means more than the right to belabour competitors. It also, in current circumstances, needs full transparency as appointments to the new regulator are made. Trust means public trust in those asked to do the regulatory job. No smoke, no closed doors as decisions are made. It would be ridiculous, after so many changes of direction, if the problem that most vexed Leveson â how to make sure Richard Desmond's Express titles had joined the party â was solved, but that manifestly independent editorial voices on press reform had been forced to sit on the sidelines. So one clear imperative, as Ipso takes shape, is to make sure it represents the whole industry. A matching responsibility, though, lies with government. At no stage, through the year since Leveson reported, has there been a proper, inclusive negotiating process: merely a series of bilaterals over pizza and coffee. Of course, constructing a broader conclave is difficult. But the plain fact is that, on point after point, Ipso is not terribly far away from what Sir Brian Leveson intended, and it might not be incapable of ticking all of his important boxes if, at last, the principals can meet face to face. This is not, essentially, a problem of political positioning ahead of an election â or of somehow securing a surface "victory" in the struggle to keep our press free by the standards of western democracy. Every grubby antic on one side threatens that freedom. Every unthinking assault on the other warps understanding, too. There are solid reasons to fear the royal charter we have, but will not join. As the Daily Telegraph said last week: "The Guardian's investigation into state spying is exactly the kind of reporting that could spark a moral panic among politicians and give them cause to limit what the press can publish. If parliament can find the numbers to impose a royal charter on the industry, it can also find the numbers to censor it." Edward Snowden's world â as a chastened America thinks again â is beyond medieval nonsenses. So is the more insular world of Westminster and Fleet Street. Comments are closed for legal reasons

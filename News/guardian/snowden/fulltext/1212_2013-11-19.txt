Keep watch on surveillance You cite California's Senator Dianne Feinstein's "spectacular about-turn" after her history of supporting the Iraq war and blanket surveillance of US and world citizens presumably as a way to pressure Britain's politicians (Leader comment, 8 November). She has done no such thing, according to other sources, since the "reform" she proposes would codify and pretty much legitimise the current practice â her way of appearing to change and control what she doesn't wish to. Meanwhile, on page one of the same issue, Suspicion fragments the web, which is "leading to the breakup of the internet as countries scramble to protect private emails and phone records from UK and US security services". Now aren't over 90% of the servers based in the US â and in California? Perhaps if the Guardian explored the economic consequences to these servers and Google, Facebook, Amazon and to the tax-collecting consequences of this potential breakup, the California senator might take notice. (Another potential story is the economic tie-in between the US and contracts with private companies, such as the one Snowden worked for, and difficult-to-get information on the campaign contributions of those secret firms). It is depressing but expected that some world leaders sit up and take notice when they are spied on, but are at peace with the massive spying on their citizens: such distrust democracies have of their citizens erodes democracy itself, which doesn't exactly bother actual terrorists. Stephen Petty Bendorf-Stromberg, Germany â¢ If the US (or Britain, for that matter) said they would reduce surveillance of their citizens and others around the globe, who in their right mind would believe them? Their reviews and protests are not credible. Thank you, Guardian, for continuing this story. Rosemary Proctor Toronto, Canada Nature's shock absorbers The havoc wreaked by typhoon Haiyan has been brutal and heartbreaking (Typhoon Haiyan's aftermath, 15 November). But we have been warned to expect such severe weather events to occur with greater frequency as the impacts of climate change become ever more difficult to deny. Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere are causing sea temperatures and levels to rise and the acidity of their waters to increase. The roots of the alarming rise in atmospheric pollution with GHGs are largely anthropogenic, but so too is the destruction of the natural barriers that reduce the severity of impact of savage weather events. Natural wetlands absorb wave and storm-surge energy and protect inland areas; mangrove swamps and coral reefs do the same. But what do we find? Wilful destruction of wetlands by drainage and canal construction for shipping; the disappearance of mangroves for fuel wood and coastal development, and the demise of coral reefs through ocean acidification, physical damage and overfishing. Protecting and enhancing these natural shock absorbers will go a long way to reducing the destructive impact of the ever more ferocious storms that we can expect in the future. Meanwhile we must, of course, continue to emphasise the pressing urgency of reducing levels of GHG pollution. There are lessons here for tropical coastal countries and also for the UK government, which seems curiously reluctant to promote the creation of marine reserves around our coasts. This is all the more bewildering as we begin to fully understand the vital importance of a healthy marine environment to our very survival. Brian Sims Bedford, UK Orwellian ideal in Spain What most strikes me about Dan Hancox's excellent account of the idealistic Spanish communist village, Marinaleda in Andalusia (8 November), is that it exemplifies the ideal for which George Orwell quite literally risked his neck in the late 1930s. Tragically, that ideal was defeated in Spain â and the world â by both the right, and hardline left, in the civil war of those years. Marinaleda resembles the kind of liberated socialism that flowered briefly in Catalonia before it was suppressed by Republican Stalinist hardliners in 1937. In Orwellian terms, the story of Marinaleda is important now because it is a reminder of the need to protect the essential true spirit of socialism from neoliberal conservatives on the one hand, and doctrinaire hardliners of the left on the other. While so much of the broader left is bogged down in futile theorising, and remains generally paralysed by inaction, the villagers in Marinaleda are actually doing something to make bottom-up socialism a reality. As Hancox indicates, we need lots of Marinaledas around the world if the flame of true socialism is to be held aloft in the face of the current economic ascendancy. And we need fair and balanced reporting of it when it happens â reporting of the fine calibre that characterises the Guardian Weekly today, and which, as Orwell himself pointed out in 1938, characterised the contemporary reportage of the Spanish civil war by the Manchester Guardian. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Russian hypocrisy is clear Hypocrisy is evident in the statement of Russia's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev "that he could not support acts that endangered the environment or human life" (Greenpeace's Arctic 30 moved to St Petersburg, 8 November). It is the Russians who are doing both. The Greenpeace team had no weapons: it was the Russians who came down from a helicopter carrying guns. The purpose of the Greenpeace team was to protect the Arctic and global environments from destruction. Russia plans to drill for oil, which could not only cause severe pollution that could not be cleaned up in the case of an oil spill, but any oil extracted would contribute to global warming, which has already brought about the melting of the Arctic sea ice that now permits access to the Arctic oil fields. This vicious circle must be stopped, and the Arctic 30 were peacefully trying to do just that. Eva Novotny Cambridge, UK Documentaries can help Issue documentaries do good box-office business but do they change anything, Steve Rose asks (8 November), to which the answer is obviously, no. But they do, of course, serve a purpose. They draw public attention to serious anomalies that exist within our current primitive system and prepare hearts and minds for its radical transformation. So, nothing wrong with that. But surely mainstream media, including this newspaper, could then also start looking at the alternative evolutionary ideas of change for a more advanced society that are now emerging, especially from the new spirituality movement. Or, is there some obstacle standing in the way of such investigations? Colin Millen Sheringham, UK Nefarious applications The mind boggles at nefarious applications of Professor John Rogers' new water-soluble silicon/silk substrate for tiny electronics â funded under the aegis of the Darpa Pentagon consortium (Discovery, 8 November). Introduced into the body, eg subcutaneously, a microchip could serve to torture or assassinate by slowly disrupting the biochemistry of endocrinology or neural networks, thus mimicking natural pathology. It could lie dormant until triggered remotely or its materials dissolve â latent and "cleaner" than the polonium-210 that allegedly finished Yasser Arafat or the ricin particle jabbed into Georgi Markov's leg via umbrella tip. Just supposin', mind you. R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US Briefly â¢ I read your article on converts to Islam (8 November) with interest, especially for the reasons given. Quite a number of Muslims convert to Christianity, but I appreciate that you could not print anything about them because popular Islam pronounces a death sentence on those who convert away. It is good that we live in a society where we are free to worship or not as we choose. Robin Minney Durham, UK â¢ Suzanne Moore's question (1 November) "Can you name me one inter-generational space you visit regularly?" may have been rhetorical, but I want to answer it anyway. Yes, the local Methodist church, and â I suspect â a great many, maybe a majority, of congregations in this country. I can't speak for other faiths, but I think they escape the problem by their social/cultural patterns. Geoffrey Bending Prince Risborough, UK â¢ There is a strange pairing of statistics in the article Japan's flight from intimacy (1 November): "61% of unmarried men and 49% of women aged 18-34 were not in any kind of romantic relationship". Are we to conclude that some of the women are married but, nevertheless, not in a romantic relationship? Keith Stotyn Edmonton, Alberta, Canada â¢ In view of the various belligerents who have been awarded the Nobel prize as champions of peace (Reply, 8 November), perhaps other more worthy and realistic nominations would include Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden. Alaisdair Raynham Truro, UK â¢ I assume the Guardian was being deliberately silly in preceding an article on the dangers of inflated expectations (25 October) with the claim that "This column will change your life."

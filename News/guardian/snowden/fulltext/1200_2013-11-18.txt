Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Germany's interior minister has criticised the US National Security Agency for its silence in response to the allegations that American spies had hacked into chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. At a special session in the Bundestag on Monday, Hans-Peter Friedrich said that contradictory comments from US intelligence directors and a reluctance to speak plainly had given rise to "conspiracy theories". Merkel said the allegations had "tested" Germany's relationship with the US and affected negotiations over a transatlantic free trade agreement. "The charges are grave and have to be cleared up." The chancellor did not comment specifically about the hacking of her phone. Parliamentarians used the opportunity not only to vent their anger over the NSA, but also at Merkel's lethargic response to the scandal. Gregor Gysi, chairman of Die Linke, said the government had allowed itself to be "lulled to sleep" by the NSA's assurances, while failing to get clear answers. Christian StrÃ¶bele, a veteran Green MP who met Edward Snowden in Moscow in October, renewed his call for Germany to offer asylum to Snowden â an offer Merkel has indicated she was unwilling to make. "Have you ever considered thanking Edward Snowden?" he asked Merkel. "After all, you have to thank him for finding out that your mobile was probably bugged." He said Merkel's refusal to speak directly about the Snowden revelations at the session was "not very brave", and reminded her that the list of questions that the German government had sent to the US in July still hadn't been answered. Merkel departed from the session soon after.

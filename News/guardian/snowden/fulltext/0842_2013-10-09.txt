Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA â¢ A fillip for the government as the BBC unveils its survey revealing the public mood on public services. We worry about care of the elderly, and we're mad as hell about road maintenance. But we seem sanguine, even after five years of coalition rule, about schools and parks, and we are pleased with the state of our libraries. But that is not to say all is well, because those who run the libraries say they face an uphill battle to keep them going, and they point an accusing finger at libraries minister Ed Vaizey. Though denied the oxygen of publicity, members of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals â not the most militant bunch in normal circumstances â has enthusiastically passed a vote of no confidence in Vaizey. This will not surprise him. The other day he was overheard admitting to an aide that he is "completely useless". So on one level, he and the library rebels agree. â¢ An impressive turn out for the 40th birthday party of Britain's first commercial radio station, LBC. Labour politicos such as Ken Livingstone, Chris Bryant and Steve Pound mingle with ministers such as the justice secretary Chris Grayling and the culture, media and sport select committee chair John Whittingdale, as well as star attraction Boris Johnson. A lavish party overlooking the Thames will always attract the powerful. The compere is the station's breakfast host, Nick Ferrari, and he explains its popularity. All the energy of the teeming metropolis, he says. And "more colour than the Ukip annual conference". Couldn't be less. â¢ An impressive list of revellers to be sure, and Ferrari makes a point of thanking both Livingstone and Boris Johnson â together for the first time since the 2012 election â for creating the London from which the station draws the bulk of its one million listeners. Livingstone hails the Blond as he arrives. "Here comes the antichrist," he says. And yet there is that empathy that results from two hard-fought elections. "Run, run again," implores Boris to his Labour soulmate. "I'm leaving the way open for you." This is how things work in self-governed London. If it isn't Ken, it must be Boris; if it isn't Boris it must be Ken. â¢ Meanwhile, sports fans continue to enjoy the autobiography of Harry Redknapp, the much-travelled football manager who continues to bemoan his luck at being passed over for the England manager's job. The Mail's extensive serialisation tells of the many players who seemed keen that he should take charge of the national team. "I got quite a few text messages at the time from players saying they would love me to manage England: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry." And the fact that he could access them shows he's not a total technophobe. Last January, during his trial and prior to his acquittal on tax evasion charges, he told the court of his battle with technology: "I can't work a computer, I don't know what an email is, I can't, I have never sent a fax and I've never even sent a text message." A few weeks later, he's seems up to speed. â¢ And that's as well for everybody, because football types like texting. They are forever talking about it. This, from Tony Pulis, the manager of Stoke City in April 2011. "He [Harry] sent me a text after the semi-final and I will ring him to find out how he prepared for the final with Portsmouth." Here's Sam Allardyce as manager of Blackburn Rovers, telling the Daily Mail in December 2008 about his dealings in the transfer market. "I was tempted to ring Harry Redknapp and ask how he did this Midas touch thing," he joked. "In the end, Harry sent me a text wishing me luck." â¢ Finally, as Lord Justice Leveson breaks cover to say not very much about media regulation, one wonders whether too much is being made of the threat to press freedom from an interfering state. For when newspapers â like the Times, maybe the Mail, perhaps the Telegraph â are prepared to be summoned by the head of MI5, Andrew "nosey" Parker, and reproduce uncritically his hyperbolic claims about the Guardian's coverage of the whistleblower Edward Snowden, one wonders why any government would feel the need to interfere with them at all.

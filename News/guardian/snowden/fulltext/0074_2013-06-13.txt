Files released by intelligence operative Edward Snowden to the Guardian have revealed a vast data collection operation by the US National Security Agency. Mobile phone metadata as well as the contents of emails and other online material has been routinely gathered with apparently minimal political and legal oversight by the NSA. The disclosure has caused outrage in the US and beyond - some of it directed at the whistleblower himself, but much of it focused on the extent of US government intrusion into data many consider private. Meanwhile in Britain, foreign secretary William Hague made a carefully-worded statement in the Commons on Britain's knowledge of the Prism program. For their part, technology companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook have made their own denials of what they knew about it. So what does it mean for national security, for trust in governments and the oversight of intelligence agencies? Joining Tom Clark are the Guardian's data editor James Ball, diplomatic editor Julian Borger and political columnist Michael White. Also this week: Michael Gove has revealed his latest plans to strengthen public confidence in GCSE qualifications. He has set out proposals for a new curriculum with less coursework and more emphasis on final exams. Can he shake off the criticism that he is harking back to a bygone age of blazers, mottoes and learning by rote? Leave your thoughts below.

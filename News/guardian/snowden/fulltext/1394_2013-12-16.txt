Andrew Miller, CEO, Guardian Media Group (GMG), today announces a series of executive management changes that will further solidify the Guardian's position as a leading global news organisation. Designed to build on the organisation's ongoing strong performance â which has seen digital revenues grow by almost 30% in the last financial year and losses significantly reduced across the Guardian News and Media (GNM) business â today's changes reflect the increased opportunities for growth and investment both in the UK and globally. David Pemsel, currently GNM's Chief Commercial Officer, takes on increased accountability for the GNM business in the newly-created role of Deputy Chief Executive, GNM. Pemsel will assume overall responsibility for all commercial operations in the UK, the US and Australia and, in so doing, will integrate and lead all three businesses into one truly global organisation. He will grow the strong domestic functions â Marketing and Audience Insight, Advertising Sales, Guardian Jobs, Guardian Labs, Consumer Revenues, Membership, and Commercial Delivery â into global functions, supporting the work of GNM's international businesses. As GNM continues to develop future growth opportunities, Tony Danker â who most recently led the successful launch of Guardian Australia and continues to lead the International, Rights and Syndication teams â will take on additional responsibilities in a broader development role for GNM. As Director, International and Partnerships, he will pursue GNM's next wave of international expansion and will manage its global partnerships with leading digital platforms. Together with the GMG Board, GNM Executive and Editorial colleagues, Danker will also identify critical new investment areas. Finally, Michael Bloom, currently CEO, Guardian US, will leave the company to pursue other opportunities, and will stay on through to the end of January 2014 to guarantee a smooth transition. David Pemsel will work closely with the US commercial team, to ensure the company is commercially focused on a unified global offering. Commenting on the changes, Andrew Miller said: "GNM is really firing on all cylinders, and we are continuing to accelerate the growth of our digital revenues and build our global audience at a pace that outstrips our competitors. In order to capitalise on the momentum we have created, now is the right time to integrate our commercial operations across the UK, US and Australia in line with our global strategy and ambitions. I believe David Pemsel will be able to maximise the huge potential we see in both the US and Australia, while Tony Danker will be able to create new opportunities and partnerships for us around the world. "We'd like to thank and recognise Michael Bloom for successfully steering Guardian US through its first two years. He helped build the business from a start-up operation to a much-respected media brand in the highly-competitive US market, with traffic growth of over 46% and revenue up 75% year-on-year. As we continue to grow we will focus on driving one global commercial strategy, to build on our enviable position as the world's third biggest English-language newspaper website and as one of its most trusted sources of news content." - ends - For further information please contact: Guardian News and Media Press Office +44 20 3353 3696 media.enquiries@theguardian.com About Guardian News and Media Guardian News and Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, the third largest English-speaking newspaper website in the world (comScore, October 2013).

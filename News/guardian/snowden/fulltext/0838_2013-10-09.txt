MI5 chief Andrew Parker's speech about Edward Snowden and Prism was more thoughtful than some of the press coverage implied. Photograph: PA On Tuesday I was in Boston debating privacy and surveillance. The audience was engaged and highly informed about the latest twists and turns in the Prism story and the saga of Edward Snowden. In Britain the vital debate about security, civil liberties and the right to know has been characterised by torpor. That is why Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, is to be praised for raising the stakes by putting the spy agencies' point of view. Before discussing the merits of his case, it is worth noting that the actual words he made in his speech are more thoughtful and sober than the spin accompanying it that was regurgitated by several newspapers yesterday. Parker's central argument â which David Cameron unsurprisingly fully endorsed â boils down to this: anyone who reveals anything about the activities of GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 is, by definition, helping terrorists. "The detail of the capabilities we use against them â¦ represent our margin of advantage," he says. The word in question here is "detail". It is one thing to reveal operational detail; it is quite another to put into the public domain the broad strategy â the remarkable revelation of the extent of the snooping that has taken place unbeknown not just to the public but to many of the politicians who are supposed to oversee the agencies. As Chris Huhne pointed out earlier this week, he had no idea about the NSA's Prism programme or GCHQ's related Tempora project â and he was a member of the UK National Security Council. Members of US Congress have expressed similar consternation about being kept in the dark; this has led to a vigorous debate and forced Barack Obama to initiate a review. By contrast, when William Hague went before parliament to respond to the Guardian's first stories in June, his message was: don't concern yourselves, the excellent chaps at the agencies are doing everything they can to keep us safe. And concern themselves they didn't. Indeed, the number of MPs and peers with a serious understanding of internet technology can be counted on the fingers of one hand. With a credulous parliament and with judges and ministers giving approval in secrecy, the "highly accountable service" that Parker proclaims is a chimera. Most statements about terrorism â on both sides of the debate â are based on supposition. When the spooks call for more powers, arguing as they have done over the communications data bill that without new measures they cannot keep the streets safe, their claim can be neither proven nor disproven. Trust is a necessary component, something we in Britain seem to have in abundance. Far more useful are transparency and accountability. At the moment, parliament's intelligence and security committee publishes only the most basic data on surveillance. What would happen if it disclosed the number of intercepts, the breakdown between email, direct messaging, phone calls and texts, and the proportion that relates to terrorism, organised crime and other serious issues? Would any of the operations be imperilled? Excessive secrecy is about more than national security; it is designed to protect organisations and individuals from embarrassment and from being properly accountable for their actions. As for our media, it picks and chooses when to get upset about erosions of liberty. The Daily Mail appeared genuinely exercised by torture allegations under the last Labour government; it sprang to the defence of the computer hacker who was fighting off extradition to the US. Several Tory-leaning papers led the way on stopping ID cards. On the Prism issue, however, they have been cheerleaders to the authorities. In August, the German magazine Der Spiegel posited one theory: remember the Olympics opening ceremony, James Bond and Her Maj and the helicopter? We love our agents. There is another possible explanation for the silence and sneers that have greeted the Guardian's coverage of the Snowden story: Leveson. Most rivals on Fleet Street think this paper has also been selective in its embrace of freedom of expression, siding as it did with advocates of greater regulation of the British press. This is payback time. With so much at stake, one might reasonably (or naively) assume that, whatever their political hue, the media might work collaboratively in challenging the powerful. For as long as the press fails in its core function and for as long as our parliamentarians remain quiescent, the security services can act as they please, accumulating information on all of us they could never have dreamed of. At one point in his speech, Parker asserts: "I too believe strongly that the public is owed an explanation of the threats the country faces and what we are doing about them." How right he is.

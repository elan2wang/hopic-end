To discuss this week's media news John Plunkett is joined by Observer writer Maggie Brown and Roy Greenslade, professor of journalism at City University. The Guardian's editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger told MPs on Tuesday that the paper "will not be put off by intimidation" â and that's how this paper covered it. But what did our colleagues on Fleet Street say? Other stories discussed on the podcast include: BBC Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan's defence of his all-male daytime lineup; the backlash against David Montgomery's plans for Local World titles and yet more procrastinating over a date for digital radio switchover. Plus, it's good news for podcasters as Radio Academy chief executive Paul Robinson reveals the categories making a comeback in the awards previously known as the Sonys. And in Rebecca Nicholson's TV lair, we find the critic devouring the latest episodes of Homeland and the X Factor, as well as Channel 4's How Video Games Changed the World and shop-doc Liberty of London.

6.31pm AEST That's all folks - at least in terms of parliamentary blogs. Time to say night night, and see you in February 2014. It's been a real pleasure covering parliament for you live in 2013 - a year with three prime ministers, an election campaign, a new government - and all kinds of drama. We've done some valedictories. Now some heartful thank you's. Thanks very much to Mike Bowers, who was a huge part of this exercise before and through the election. Thanks to Paul Owen who also weighed in wonderfully during the campaign. Thanks too to Gabrielle Chan, who tended the blog while I was catching my breath (ha), covering the breaking news and chasing spies over the past few weeks. And of course to Lenore Taylor and Daniel Hurst who manage my bouts of blog brain with incredible grace. Thank you to the #auspol crowd who keep me company online: you folks are such a wonderful, engaged, passionate audience - and to Guardian Australia readers, who are a great bunch of people to serve. To fellow bloggers and podcasters and columnists and news hounds - and particularly to "live" colleagues in the parliamentary press gallery. There are more and more of us every year, and its a practice we just have to get right for the sake of the readers and the viewers we serve. We all know it, and we are working like blazes to do good journalism. Sometimes we do it, sometimes we fall short - but there's no lack of commitment. Thanks to the politicians, who have delivered truly epic tales in 2013, and who are engaging with our own perfect storm of structural adjustments in the digital 24/7 revolution, mostly cheerfully, even though it must be hell. Thanks to the staffers and the denizens of the parliament, who are also mainly cheerful and often incredibly helpful despite .. well everything. Have a tip top festive season in the event I don't rejoin you in the live blog format until next year. Thanks again for your support.

Nick Brown has said there is 'uncanny' similarity between GCHQ programmes exposed by Edward Snowden and the draft communications data bill's proposals. Photograph: Carl Court/PA The impact of government surveillance on legal confidentiality goes further than undermining civil actions against the state (Spies accused of ignoring MPs, 16 October). Every person accused of crime, terrorism or immigration matters who is legally represented is in contact with their lawyers, so if the government monitors the target they will be monitoring legal communications. Lawyers have to discuss their clients' cases, send and receive instructions etc. It's impractical to use an office phone/website every time or demand the client come in to discuss this in private â and there are cases where even the fact of the client attending an appointment is an issue. So lawyers and their agents, like myself, use their own phones, we often give the police our contact details and trust that Big Brother isn't going to abuse this by monitoring these, especially when I report back to the instructing solicitor or the advocate representing the client at court what the case is about, assess the evidence, say what the client's instructions were. In short, surveillance affects defence solicitors in every immigration/criminal/terrorism case. Anil Bhatt Sunderland â¢ You report the comments of Lord Blencathra and Nick Brown MP as to information they did not receive from the intelligence agencies during hearings of the parliamentary committee chaired by Lord Blencathra on the proposed communications data bill. Your report suggests information was "hidden from MPs". In fact, two parliamentary committees were taking evidence on this issue. While Lord Blencathra took considerable evidence regarding the police and law enforcement bodies, the intelligence and security committee took evidence from the intelligence agencies on secret matters and had access to classified material which the other parliamentary committee could not. Arising from that evidence, we reported to parliament that the intelligence and security agencies already have access to communicartions data, and had less immediate need than the police and other law enforcement agencies for the proposed bill "because they are able to work around the problem through the use of other national security capabilities" under existing legislation. These comments in our published report reflected the evidence that we had received Malcolm Rifkind MP Chairman, intelligence and security committee â¢ In light of your editorial (16 October), I would like to point out that parliament recently had the opportunity to debate the democratic accountability of the security services, during the passage of the Justice and Security Act. Both Yvette Cooper and I argued for extensive reform of the intelligence and security committee, including for the chair to be a member of the opposition and for there to be a majority of democratically elected MPs as members of the committee. We also pressed for pre-appointment hearings for heads of security agencies, for more public sessions and for greater investigative capacity for the ISC. The shadow home secretary has also set out plans to reform the commissioners system because gone are the days of paper-based accountability checks. The coalition parties, including the Lib Dems, had an opportunity to support all of these proposals and include them. They chose not to back Labour's plans. Diana Johnson MP Shadow crime and security minister â¢ Boris Johnson needs to make up his mind on undercover cops and sex (Report, 15 October). City Hall's police committee has been told by him and the head of the Met, Bernard Hogan-Howe, that it's not acceptable for undercover police to have sex with the people they are targeting and that pre-authorisation for a sexual relationship would never be given. But the mayor is using public money to pay for the Met's lawyers to argue in court this week that undercover police could be and were authorised to have sexual relationships. There is a significant difference between what the mayor is saying to the media and what his lawyers are saying in court. This is symptomatic of the complete confusion the Met has on this issue. I hope in the interests of transparency and justice the women are successful in their appeal. Jenny Jones Green party group, London assembly â¢ Years ago we had one or two headline stories about spies, with Maclean, Philby, Blake, Burgess et al all exposed and condemned. Now, the only "spies" we hear about are the ones who voluntarily broadcast their secrets. So with one low-ranked US army recruit and a contractor who is not even enlisted in the US forces, we are told that some of the most serious leaks of US/UK intelligence in modern times has occurred, representing a major threat to the security of our countries. Well, if these two can dig up this stuff, goodness knows what is accessible to the real spies these days. These events prove that our (UK/US and others) security services are useless when it comes to preventing access to classified information. It also suggests that undesirable agents can probably find a way to access and copy files of internet traffic metadata and interrogate these for their own evil ends. And, somehow, at the very top of our governments, the actions of Manning and Snowden are being condemned while any real security leaks are, no doubt, never reported. Now that these two have alerted us all to the potential frailties of the security systems, we need proper governance and regulation to protect the public, not just serve the interests of those who gather and manipulate this "information". Robert Walker Bristol â¢ I find myself wondering that if an officer with access to communications data suspected, say, that I was having an affair with his wife, what would stop him from looking at data on my emails and mobile phone calls â and hers. Have I missed something? Chris Harris Lymington, Hampshire â¢ "36b.

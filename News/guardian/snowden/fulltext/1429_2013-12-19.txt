When Barack Obama stood before Congress in February to deliver his state of the union address, it sounded like a throwback to another time. This wasn't the Obama we'd watched during his first term being battered by the vagaries of a collapsing economy and an intransigent Republican opposition. This was Obama as we had known him in 2008: the young man with a spring in his step and unbounded confidence, the Obama of "Yes We Can!" He set out a robust agenda for his second term that would seal his legacy as a transformative president. He would honour the memories of the 20 young children who had died in a gun rampage in Newtown, Connecticut, two months earlier by introducing bold new gun control laws; he would open a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants languishing in the shadows; he would put America back on a sound budgetary footing; he would tackle the knotty problems of the Syrian civil war and Iran's nuclear programme; he even began to talk again about climate change. Observers were struck by how reinvigorated Obama seemed after his November victory against Mitt Romney. For a few brief weeks liberal America allowed itself to hope again. And then, faster than even his detractors had predicted, the unravelling began. Within weeks Obama had been outmanoeuvred by the National Rifle Association, the pro-firearms lobby, which mobilised its supporters on Capitol Hill to kill his gun reform aspirations stone dead. In April, Obama was forced to appear in the Rose Garden of the White House and, with tearful Newtown parents flanking him, admit defeat. It was a "pretty shameful day for Washington", he lamented, without acknowledging that some of the shame was undoubtedly on him. By the late summer, the second major plank of Obama's agenda â comprehensive immigration reform â had also fallen by the wayside, blocked by the Republicans in the House. With measures designed to establish his legacy as the progressive reforming president stymied at every pass, Obama's renewed popularity among left-leaning Americans quickly paled â a drift made worse by harsh executive actions on behalf of the administration. The justice department was revealed to have tapped phone lines used by Associated Press journalists as part of a leak inquiry. And that was just one example of how the US government was clamping down on leakers and whistleblowers with an aggression rarely seen before. In July, Chelsea Manning â Bradley as she then was â was convicted of 21 counts relating to the massive transfer of US state secrets to WikiLeaks, and was sentenced to 35 years in military custody. Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor who brought to the Guardian a separate trove of secret documents relating to state digital surveillance, joined Manning to become the eighth person charged by the Obama administration under the Espionage Act â more than double the number of such prosecutions brought by all previous US presidents combined. Obama made a speech in May that was billed as a historic turning point, in which he promised an end to the "perpetual war" unleashed by 9/11. Addressing the nation just a month after the Boston bombings, when three people died and many more were injured at the finishing line of the marathon, Obama said: "This war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises, it's what our democracy demands." He pledged a reduction in the use of drone strikes on terror suspects and a renewed push to close GuantÃ¡namo Bay. Yet drone strikes continued in Pakistan and Yemen, and the GuantÃ¡namo detention camp remained open, while its inmates were subjected to the humiliation of forced feeding when they went on hunger strike. At times it seemed that the new, modern and tolerant America that Obama evoked was emerging in spite of, rather than because of, him. One of the great cultural waves of the year, the spread of gay marriage across the country, was led by the courts and state legislatures rather than through presidential decree. The US supreme court struck down part of the Defence of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples, while seven more states adopted gay marriage in the course of 2013, bringing the total to 16. Abroad, Obama faced similar struggles to project his ambitions. But with fewer constraints on his executive power from an unwieldy Congress, he enjoyed greater success. November's six-month deal between Washington and the new government of Hassan Rouhani in Tehran represented an astonishing turnaround in an increasingly belligerent relationship. Under the deal, Iran was given the promise of an easing of sanctions that have brought its banking sector and much of its economy to a standstill, in exchange for restrictions on its uranium enrichment. From Obama's perspective, it gave the president and his newly ensconced secretary of state, John Kerry, a rare chance to point to real achievement. More significantly, it boosted what the New York Times called the new centrepiece of US foreign policy: "diplomacy, the venerable but often-unsatisfying art of compromise". In Syria, diplomacy also prevailed in the end, though the path to it was much more messy. Obama's dance around the issue of President Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of lethal nerve gas on civilians in a suburb of Damascus left the US leader at times looking wavering and hesitant. He threatened to launch air strikes against the Syrian regime for having crossed his own "red line" over chemical weapons use, then stalled to give Congress a vote on the issue, before calling off the strikes altogether when Russia's Vladimir Putin called his bluff by offering to broker a deal with Assad that would put Syria's chemical weapons under international supervision. Messy though it was, Obama got what he wanted on Syria â action on chemical weapons, without the US being drawn militarily into the conflict. But the civil war in Syria continues to sap America's standing as the world's only superpower and with it Obama's reputation as its resolute commander-in-chief. Back home, Obama looked to be ending the year on a better note than its shaky start. He came out of the 16-day shutdown of the federal government in October, the first since 1996, not exactly smelling of roses but at least in better shape than the Republicans. The party leadership had played a high-stakes game of poker, handing the initiative to the Tea Party faction spearheaded by senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and lost. The disarray of the Republicans was one small comfort for Obama, but he ends the year in a rut that is purely of his own making: the debacle over the rollout of Obamacare. It is a paradox that Obama stumbled most heavily in 2013 in precisely that area in which he has been strongest: the use of technology in politics. He won re-election in 2012 in no small part because of his command of social media and the power of the internet as a campaigning tool. But when it came to launching the biggest change in social welfare in America in a generation, one that would give millions of uninsured Americans access to healthcare and that should be the high point of his years in office, his administration fell flat on its face. It couldn't create a website that worked without crashing. It all made that rediscovered mood of "Yes We Can!" that Obama summoned up at the start of the year seem oh, so very long ago.

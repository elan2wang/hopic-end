Australia’s national security service has issued a thinly veiled attack on the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in the release of its 2013 annual report. In a section on espionage, the annual Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) report describes a “constant source of potential harm to Australia’s national interests” as a result of “betrayals of trust by individuals who have gained legitimate access to national systems and environments”. It continues: “Successful clandestine foreign intelligence service penetration of the Australian government has the potential to cause significant damage to Australian national interests.” It also suggests Asio has ramped up the assessment of intelligence agents with access to sensitive documents. “These matters bring into sharp focus the need to maintain robust and rigorous standards when assessing an individual’s suitability for access to classified material,” it says. The report goes on to say that Australia faces an increased threat posed by “malicious activity conducted by cyber means” due to a “more interconnected society”. The report also contains information on the number of visas being assessed by the security service. More than 6,000 extra visas were assessed in the latest reporting period than in the previous, up from 24,097 to 29,449. The number of unauthorised maritime arrivals assessed by Asio appears to have fallen from 4,760 to 3,394 while the number of offshore/humanitarian and temporary visas has risen. It also notes the inquiry into asylum seekers presents complex security issues. The inquiry was commissioned by the Gillard government to examine in particular the security service's handling of the case of Sayed Abdellatif, an Egyptian asylum seeker. It says the inquiry is ongoing.

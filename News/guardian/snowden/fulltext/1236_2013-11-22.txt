"Camilla Kvartoft intervjuar brittiske kriminaljournalisten Duncan Campbell, The Guardian." I don't think I need to translate that. I am putting this video up because there is so much to enjoy, right from the first moment when Campbell contrasts the respectful Swedish journalists' awards ceremony in Stockholm with those he has witnessed in Britain. The crime reporter's crime reporter, who left The Guardian in 2010 after 23 years with the paper, laces his wisdom with wit in answering a series of questions about his journalistic experiences. At about 12 minutes in, he discusses the current chilly relationship between the police and reporters. Soon after that he explains why he organised the funeral of "master criminal" Peter Scott and how they played the spiritual song Steal Away in the crematorium. Campbell is also good on the Edward Snowden leaks and the "pathetic" response of other British newspapers to The Guardian's publication of the material. Source: YouTube

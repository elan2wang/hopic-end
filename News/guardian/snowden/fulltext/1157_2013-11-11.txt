4.31pm GMT • Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP, has been ordered to apologise to the House of Commons for failing to declare her fee for appearing on ITV's I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! programme last year. As Rowena Mason reports, Dorries did not declare her payment on the register of members' interests, claiming she did not have to because it was made to her company, Averbrook, rather than to her personally. She also refused to tell the parliamentary commissioner for standards how much she received for appearing on the reality television show, saying she had a confidentiality agreement with ITV. However, the standards committee, a cross-party group of MPs, found Dorries should never have signed such a confidentiality agreement. It also agreed with Kathryn Hudson, the independent parliamentary standards commissioner, that Dorries had breached the code through her "attitude to the commissioner's inquiries". The report reveals that at one point Dorries accused Hudson of conducting a "witch hunt" and threatened to sue her.

He made the point, in an apparent reference to the concerns raised by Sir John Major, at a Number 10 event highlighting the take-up in the four weeks since the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme was launched. Cameron said:  This is about social mobility. The fact is that without Help to Buy we were beginning to see a country where only people who had wealthy mums and dads who could give them the money for their deposit were able to buy a flat or a house. Many of the people standing behind me have only been able to buy a flat or a house because they can now get a bigger mortgage without such a large deposit. They can afford those mortgage payments and they will be able to achieve their dream of owning their own flat or home. This scheme is about social mobility, it's about helping people who don't have rich parents to get on and achieve their dream of home ownership which is why it's so welcome. On the World at One Graeme Leach, the Institute of Directors' chief economist, said that Help to Buy was like a "drug" for politicians and that it would drive up house prices. Yes, more people will get on the housing ladder, but they will pay more for the privilege, because we have a situation where if we try to stimulate demand for the housing market in the UK, there are so many restrictions on supply that it just drives up the price. What the housing market really needs is Help to Supply, not Help to Buy. Our concern is this is a drug that politicians could get hooked on and it will be very difficult to get them off, because people will start saying 'If we withdraw the scheme, it will drive down prices and make the economy weaker'. Once we get into this process and once we get this policy embedded, it is going to be very difficult to get off it. But, at the Number 10 event, Cameron said Help to Buy would increase the supply of housing available for sale. [Help to Buy} does help unlock the problem of a shortage of housing supply. Put frankly, the builders won't build, the developers won't develop unless the buyers are able to buy. That's why we are seeing growing levels of housing investment and housebuilding in our country. The two issues are linked. • William Hague has said Britain does not want to let the opportunity for a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme slip away. .@WilliamJHague: We must build momentum behind Geneva negotiations & we & Iran must ensure opportunity of making progress does not slip away— Foreign Office (FCO) (@foreignoffice) November 11, 2013 .@WilliamJHague: These were complex & detailed discussions, covering every aspect of #Iranâs nuclear programme.— Foreign Office (FCO) (@foreignoffice) November 11, 2013 .@WilliamJHague: #E3+3 Foreign Ministers presented same united position to #Iran, which gives a strong foundation for next round of talks.— Foreign Office (FCO) (@foreignoffice) November 11, 2013 .@WilliamJHague: Govt firmly in favour of reaching an interim agreement with Iran, as an essential step towards a comprehensive settlement.— Foreign Office (FCO) (@foreignoffice) November 11, 2013 • John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, has said that he will submit evidence to the court of appeal in relation to a case involving Lord Triesman that could undermine parliamentary privilege. Triesman is subject to legal action in relation to comments he made at an inquiry (without the protection of parliamentary privilege) where he repeated, but did not expand upon, comments he made to a select committee (with the protection of privilege) about alleged Fifa corruption. On a point of order, John Whittingdale, the chair of the Commons culture committee, said that if Triesman could be sued, witnesses would worry about giving evidence to select committee. Bercow said he shared these concerns. Bercow said this case was a “cause for grave concern”. I consider these matters to be of such importance for this House and for its members and for the protection of free speech in our proceedings that written submissions have been made to the court on my behalf. • Theresa May, the home secretary, has become the latest Tory cabinet minister to criticise the publication of stories based on Edward Snowden's NSA leaks, saying anything that "potentially gives help to terrorists" is something the government "needs to be concerned about and act on". • Thirteen people, including the girlfriend of former News International chief executive Les Hinton, knew about a secret relationship David Blunkett was having, a former aide to the then home secretary has told the phone-hacking trial. That's all for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at 4.38pm GMT

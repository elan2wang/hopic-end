â¢ An article about an EU blueprint for rescuing failing banks said that savers with deposits under â¬100,000 would be tapped for cash before a bank was given a taxpayer-funded bailout. It is savers with deposits over that amount who would be among those footing the bill for saving a bank (Banks will need to tap shareholders before they get bailed out, says EU, 28 June, page 40). â¢ Speculation was raised in an article about the Jamaican-German tennis player Dustin Brown that he might have been eligible to represent Great Britain in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches because he has a British connection through his grandmother. He would not be eligible to play for any Fed Cup team: it is a women's competition (One that got away? Hewitt conqueror has British link, 27 June, page 15). â¢ Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, not a special autonomous region, as we had it in an article about the intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden (Hong Kong, Moscow, Quito? Snowden seeks asylum in Ecuador after landing in Russia, 24 June, page 1). â¢ Homophone corner: "Before Paltrow, most actresses and models towed the party line" (The ascent of the age of discipline, 27 June, page 6, G2). â¢ Edward Snowden: Hong Kong escape may prevent more poisonous row was amended because a subheading incorrectly referred to Hong Kong as an "autonomous island". A further article, NSA surveillance: anger mounts in Congress at 'spying on Americans', was amended because it wrongly described Hong Kong as a "Chinese province".

Is sonar harming the whales? A medal for valour is owed to the panel of scientists who concluded that sonar mapping was the most probable cause of a mass stranding of whales in Madagascar, and presumably that of the many other strandings with the same acoustic coincidence, despite the displeasure it brought to the oil industry doing the mapping (Panel links sonar to whale stranding, 18 October). Scientific detachment is not without risks, as the profession's battles with the pesticide and tobacco industries have famously demonstrated. High-power sonar pollution is but one of a multi-pronged human assault on the world's ocean ecosystem, as new technology emerges to mine toxic metals in the deepest oceans, as well as pursue the dwindling fish stocks standing in the way of jellyfish plagues. This is complemented by the increasing political influence enjoyed by extraction industries as their financial clout becomes ever more critical to the chance of success in supposedly democratic electoral systems. The response of Exxon Mobil to the panel's findings suggests they may be as indifferent to their effects on others as are conventional extremists. John Hayward Weegena, Tasmania, Australia Dawkins's flaw of logic I've been waiting for someone to spot the logical fallacy in Richard Dawkins's statement regarding Muslim academic achievement versus that of the Jews ('I don't think I am strident or aggressive', 27 September): "Something like between 20% and 25% of all Nobel prizes have gone to Jews, who are less than 1% of the world's population. That's a very embarrassing comparison." Why is it embarrassing? Is it also shameful that Muslims don't score highly in the World Tango Championships? They even do badly in the Olympic's slalom events. Amazingly, Jews also rate poorly in the above contests. Dawkins has confused the Nobel prize, a cultural artefact, with an essential requirement for being civilised. The reason why Muslims do not rate well in the Nobel sweepstakes is that they don't enter that competition: it is not in their cultural repertoire, just as the tango and slalom are not. What is in the Muslim portfolio is centuries of magnificent architecture, music and literature. The conflation of culture with ability shows that we easily imbibe propaganda, thus dismissing other civilisations as inferior, as we apply the standards of our own cultural imperialism without realising it. Sam Nejad Geraldton, Western Australia Class can determine success The feature on Naina Lal Kidwai (India's trailblazer for women, 4 October), positioned alongside the one on Strasbourg's "petit business", made me wonder how many potential trailblazers have had their dreams buried. The "boss of bosses" had a family able to send her to Harvard Business School and surely had many other doors held open for her. In contrast, the petit businesswomen of the world see an awful lot of shut doors. This is not to begrudge Lal Kidwai her success; no woman rises to the top in India without facing and fighting sexism. But it is to recognise that class and privilege remove the rough edges of the journey to the top, even for women. The "first female voice of Indian capitalism"? FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bobin seems to have overlooked the gutsy female entrepreneurs surviving a hostile urban Indian landscape. Talk to them: they have been around a long, long time. Veena Krishnamurthy Dublin, Ireland Everyone knows risks of war Along with, I am sure, many others, I was absolutely appalled by some of the content in your article in the issue of 4 October (MoD discussion paper sets out how to sell wars to the public). The soldiers referred to were not conscripts: they signed on voluntarily for service in the British Army. Since time immemorial, armies have been engaged in fighting wars, some of them just and some of them not. The soldiers who have signed on know only too well just what risks they may face, and so should their families and loved ones. They are comparatively well-paid, compared with those of previous years, and have pension entitlements and other benefits far in excess of those of earlier years. The landmark ruling referred to could open a whole can of worms. Just think of the poor conscripts, who died in their thousands, having been simply used as "cannon fodder" by inept and incompetent generals. The carnage at Gallipoli was another instance of sheer incompetence and poor planning. If the minimal casualties of these more moderns wars are to be accorded the right to damages under human rights legislation, how much more right should be accorded to those poor conscripts of earlier wars? Michael Scarr Old Bar, NSW, Australia New arrivals are in danger That the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has risen 40% since 1750 (Scientists say only 30 years to calamity unless we act, 4 October) hides the more alarming statistic that it has risen over 5% (from about 376ppm to 396ppm) in the last 10 years and the rate of increase shows signs of a further rise. Unless you're a plant, carbon dioxide is not exactly what you want in the atmosphere more than is absolutely necessary, and there is no guarantee that any hoped-for increase in crop productivity will be any compensation given CO2's potentially lethal property of trapping warm air and the attendant consequences. Some may be holding out hope that the great human race can somehow adapt in time but it just may be that for once being a creationist (if this belief proves right) might be a more likely road to salvation than being a Darwinist (unless you happen to be very fit). It was therefore with some surprise that one finding of the latest IPCC report was that indigenous Australians face "disproportionate harm from climate change" (Australia climate warning, 18 October). Unlike their non-indigenous neighbours (yes, most of them live on the coast), the first Australians didn't need the word "sustainability" to know what it's all about. As the sea levels start to rise and with heading inland not looking particularly attractive to the new arrivals, it's more likely that the old locals will line up on shore, and after nearly 300 years of occupation, wave them goodbye as they head out to find another "lucky country". Left behind will be tragic extinctions, lots of exotic pests, large areas of degraded land and some very large holes in the ground, but our indigenous friends will just carry on where they left off in 1788. Chris Beadle Battery Point, Tasmania, Australia Digital publishing a boon Many thanks for Short, sweet and straight to the point (11 October) on the subject of digital publishing. This article was timely and helpful: Kindle was something I had heard about, but failed to connect to the publication of short writing between 5,000 and 30,000 words and the difficulty of having such work published. So, yes, I read the article three times and promptly sent my masterpiece to Kindle Single at Amazon, attached to email. The response was swift and courteous. They will get back to me within six weeks and let me know about it. Most regular publishers would try to dissuade you from sending them your work in the first place. John Nesling Courtenay, British Columbia, Canada Teachers deserve our praise So "only" one-third of those who are not succeeding in school are from officially designated poor families, and in London those children do 50% better than in other areas (18 October). Surely this should be a cause for celebration. The education these children are receiving is going some way to compensate for deprivation. Sadly, the article went on to imply that the London Salary Weighting attracts better teachers. I taught in London for 20 years, my standard of living was always lower than that of fellow teachers outside the capital despite the weighting, and I never met a teacher in an inner-city school motivated primarily by pay. Let's give praise to dedication and hard work and to pupils who are succeeding, and encourage professionals from London to share their expertise to help colleagues in other areas. Rose Leibowitz Sherman Oaks, California, US Briefly â¢ David Cameron in the House of Commons has accused the Guardian of "damaging national security" in publishing data concerning the activities of the US's National Security Agency and the UK's GCHQ that was obtained by Edward Snowden (25 October). If indeed national security has been damaged, this has surely been caused by the appalling lack of security at the NSA. What conceivable reason can there be for allowing anybody to download 58,000 secret documents, and with, apparently, no alarm being raised and no record being made? Terry Jones Carlisle, UK â¢ I have been writing a book on the missionary period in Scandinavia in which, with regard to the persistence of attitudes from the Viking age, I make the sweeping statement that "European culture has never to this day entirely taken on board Christ's teaching that one should love one's enemies". It seems to me, however, that the Norwegian prison authorities' treatment of Anders Breivik in allowing him to undertake university studies (20 September) has to be regarded as a noteworthy exception to that rule. Janet Fairweather Ely, UK â¢ Regarding the article on food wastage (27 September) and the reply from Graham Andrews (Reply, 18 October) suggesting that the only plausible solution to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in adequate amounts to prevent climate change is photosynthesis: are we to understand that we should be erecting more greenhouses?

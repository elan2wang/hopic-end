What does a president have to do to get noticed around here? Photograph: Charles Dharapak/AP On the day his administration played a key role in international efforts to agree a deal to limit Iran's nuclear programme, Barack Obama has been named among the top 25 "least influential people" of 2013. The president is number 17 on the list, according to its publisher, GQ magazine, because "nothing gets done." The former NBA star Dennis Rodman is the magazine's No1 least influential celebrity of the year. The 52-year-old, who attracted publicity when he visited Kim Jong Un in North Korea, was named ahead of twerking pop star Miley Cyrus, Obama and celebrity chef Paula Deen. GQ called Rodman a "Q-list celebrity willing to commit borderline treason just to hang out with a dictator who himself aspires to be a Q-list celebrity". Rodman said this week he is preparing to return to North Korea late next month, for an exhibition basketball tour. Deen, who this year admitted to having used racist language to describe black employees, came in at number two, while the former Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose run for mayor of New York fell apart amidst repeated "sexting" scandals, was named at number three. "He's the saddest lecher in American politics, and that's saying something, because they're all lechers," the magazine said. Cyrus, who garnered attention at this year's MTV Video Music Awards for her provocative performance with a foam finger, was No6, for "basically trying every inane strategy she could think of to rile up America's few remaining pearl clutchers". The magazine added: "What's sad is that it totally worked." Other celebrities on the list include Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and Will Smith. The president was deemed even less influential than Ryan Reynolds, Lennay Kekua (Manti Te'o's fake dead girlfriend) and whistleblower Edward Snowden.

8.59am AEST Holden is a very difficult issue for the Coalition to manage. The government is divided internally about whether or not to subsidise car manufacturers. Economic dries in the Liberal Party see this is a question of picking winners, and throwing good money after bad. Industry minister Ian Macfarlane for his part has been trying to persuade his colleagues since the September election to come to the table with more cash for Holden. Macfarlane, a political pragmatist, has no philosophical problem with business welfare. The opposition has been ramping up the political pressure. My colleague, Guardian Australia political editor Lenore Taylor, reports that Labor claims it left a special pot of money in the budget’s “contingency reserve” to fully cover car industry assistance until 2017, including assistance required to keep Holden’s manufacturing plants in Australia. “The money is there, they don’t need to make any call on the budget until 2017,” the former Labor industry minister Senator Kim Carr told Guardian Australia. Unions are ramping up the pressure. The manufacturing union flooded the airwaves this morning with tales of the stress the Holden workforce is currently enduring. This is a genuinely definitional decision for the new prime minister Tony Abbott. As my former Age colleague Tim Colebatch pointed out in a very fine column signing off from the Melbourne newspaper this morning, this whole issue more than an economic seminar. These are big stakes. In 2011-12, the industry employed more than 45,000 people, and produced $5.4 bn of net output: $2.2 bn from making cars, and $3.2 bn from making parts and components. Its reach through the economy is huge, with thousands of suppliers. A study by Allen Consulting Group estimates in Melbourne alone, its closure could cost 33,000 jobs, and cut the nation's output by $7.3bn a year. The numbers are speculative, but clearly, this will be a huge economic shock.

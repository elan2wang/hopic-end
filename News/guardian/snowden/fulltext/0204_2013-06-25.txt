The Independent's 'Edward Snowden' photo appeared in its digital-only version. Turns out Monkey's Monday tale about the Independent front page wrongly identifying another man arriving in Moscow as NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden â¦ was wrong itself, in one important detail. Indy night editor Andy Webster has been in touch to tell us that the front page in question was a digital-only version put out to broadcasters for their late evening first edition paper reviews. The picture was changed to one of Snowden before the Indy's first edition, so the cock-up never actually made it into print. Monkey is happy to put the record straight ... and it just goes to show we all make mistakes.

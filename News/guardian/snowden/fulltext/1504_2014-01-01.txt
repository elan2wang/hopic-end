Pop Courtney Love's memoir The question is not so much "what will be in Courtney Love's book?" as "what could possibly be in Courtney Love's book that she hasn't already spoken/ranted/raved about?" Still, her self-titled autobiography has been described as "too crazy not to be true" and should provide her definitive take on her time with Hole and her doomed relationship with Kurt Cobain. It will also, hopefully, spill previously unspilled beans on her relationships with Billy Corgan and Steve Coogan. Oh, and according to an interview she did with Rolling Stone, it was inspired by Russell Brand's My Booky Wook. The mind boggles. TJ Everything to do with Kanye West Kanye has hinted that a seventh studio album of his should see the light in 2014. But even without the prospect of this "minimalist eight-track" affair, be sure that Kanye's quotes, wild displays and jaw-dropping motorbike-humping videos will make him the most talked about pop star of the year. Again. TJ Metallica and Iron Maiden team up for Sonisphere The two heavy-metal giants have never played at the same festival in the UK until now, so expect Knebworth Park to be suffering from severe tinnitus by the time July has finished. TJ Film 12 Years a Slave Steve McQueen's Oscar-bound drama about Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in pre-civil war America, is remarkable, if not for its classy performances (Michael Fassbender's volatile plantation owner is chillingly good), then for the fact that it's based on a true story. McQueen uses Solomon's personal anguish to cut to the heart of a superpower's relationship with the slave trade. Henry Barnes 10 January. The Wolf of Wall Street Martin Scorsese's bleak Wall Street comedy arrives after the reckoning, but is set before the crash. Based loosely on the book by former trader Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral money man snorting his way through multiple millions as the stock climbs higher and the party gets louder. There's no nod to the recession, no attempt to find meaning in excess. Just more money, more drugs, more fun. Morality is for wimps. HB 17 January. Nymphomaniac Sex. Four hours of the stuff, with a brief interval for the audience. Lars von Trier â him of the genital mutilation (Antichrist) and the extended disability joke (The Idiots) â knows how to push our buttons. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin share panting duties as Jo, a sex addict detailing her conquests to an older male confidante. Von Trier premiered the film, which contains scenes of penetrative sex, bondage and fellatio, on Christmas Day. Happy holidays! HB 21 February. Transcendence Christopher Nolan proved that brainiac sci-fi could do well at the box office with Inception. Now his cinematographer, Wally Pfister, puts his mind to directing with a similarly cerebral thriller. Johnny Depp plays an artificial intelligence researcher who is willing to sacrifice himself to create a sentient machine. Rebecca Hall and Paul Bettany play fellow researchers, trying to pull him back from the brink. HB 25 April. Gone Girl Gillian Flynn's bestseller gets a big-screen adaptation. Ben Affleck plays a struggling journalist implicated in the disappearance of his wife (Rosamund Pike), who went missing on the day of their fifth anniversary. Set in the heart of recession-hit small town America, Gone Girl is a gritty suspense story. It'll need someone experienced in delivering grim-minded thrillers to direct. Step forward Mr David Fincher. HB 3 October. Veronica Mars Kickstarter's great success story. The film version of Veronica Mars, a cult US TV show in which Kristen Bell's high-school super-sleuth solves crimes in her downtime, was floundering in development. Then creator Rob Thomas turned to the 90,000 fans on the internet that were ready to chip in and see the film made. Cue a shift in our understanding of film financing and a wave of other film-makers (Spike Lee, Zach Braff, James Franco) begging funds off Joe Public. HB A Million Ways to Die in the West Family Guy creator/swing crooner/feminist-baiting Oscar host Seth MacFarlane steps out from behind the camera with this comedy western. MacFarlane plays a yellow-bellied sheep farmer whose lack of courage costs him his gal (Amanda Seyfried). Only a rambunctious adventure across the old west, a duel with an infamous outlaw (Liam Neeson) and many, many dick jokes can help our hero get back on the horse. HB 6 June. Dance Akram Khan Akram Khan has joined forces with some extraordinary dance artists during his career, from Sylvie Guillem to Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. This autumn's project should deliver sparks as Khan creates and performs a duet with flamenco iconoclast Israel Galvan. Judith Mackrell Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (0844 412 4300) TV Inside KFC We've already been inside Greggs, Claridge's, Liberty and Iceland, and now we'll get to see inside the mighty KFC. An upcoming three-part BBC1 documentary promises "unprecedented access" to the company, from boardroom to the lowly restaurant chef. It'll be worth watching for no other reason than to see if the truth of KFC is closer to the adverts (tender-eyed men stroking organic chicken wings) or most people's experiences (cross-eyed hen night revellers staggering up to the counter at 3am, bellowing "BARGAIN BUCKET"). Stuart Heritage BBC1 The Jump (Channel 4) The BBC has Celebrity MasterChef, where famous people cook things. ITV has Splash!, where famous people jump into some water. And now Channel 4 has The Jump, where famous people strap planks of wood on to their feet and shoot off an icy ramp at 40mph. If you've ever wanted to see what Anthea Turner looks like writhing around in agony with two broken legs, or what Nicky Clarke looks like strapped to a gurney, this might just be the show for you. SH Channel 4 Snow joke â¦ counting down to the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Photograph: Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images Sochi Winter Olympics The Winter Olympics never tend to catch the public's imagination to the extent of its summer counterpart. The 2014 games look set to go the same way, thanks to the outcry and drip-by-drip boycott over Russia's human rights violations. However, Olympic fever is still strong here, so it might only take one British medallist to get everyone tuning in again. SH BBC The Trial Recent high-profile controversies about the ethics and outcomes of drug trials have meant the use of humans for pharmaceutical testing has become a recurrent subject in popular culture: including Lucy Prebble's National Theatre play The Effect and an episode of the Channel 4 drama series Fresh Meat. This potentially fascinating documentary follows the participants in a 2013 trial at Frenchay hospital in Bristol, aimed at finding a new treatment for Parkinson's disease. Mark Lawson BBC2 Theatre The Mistress Contract Based on a real-life story, TV and film writer Abi Morgan's return to the stage has a tantalising premise: the long-running relationship between a man, 93, and his mistress, 88. He provides her with bed and board, she with "all sexual acts as requested, with suspension of historical, emotional, psychological disclaimers". Andrew Dickson Royal Court, London SW1 (020-7565 5000), 30 January to 22 March. This May Hurt A Bit As Danny Boyle's 2012 Olympic opening ceremony proved, the NHS is part of the British psyche â which is probably why it hurts when things go wrong. The latest from Out of Joint explores one family's journey through the digestive tract of the NHS. Will they be spat out? LG Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds (01284 769505), 6 to 15 March. Then touring. Pests As she proved with 2011's Mogadishu, a tough-minded study of Britain's educational system, ex-teacher and playwright Vivienne Franzmann is never afraid to say the unsayable. Here she takes on the failings of the care system, mental health and addiction. LG Royal Exchange, Manchester, (0161-833 9833), 12 to 22 March, then touring. Union Breaking up is hard to do â and if you've been together since 1707, it's easy to forget what brought you together in the first place. In the year of the Scottish referendum, playwright Tim Barrow reminds us of the story behind the Act of Union and the larger-than-life historical characters involved. Lyn Gardner Lyceum, Edinburgh (0131-248 4848), 20 March to 12 April. Privacy With Edward Snowden's NSA/GCHQ revelations making headlines throughout 2013, the Donmar is keen to prove it's on top of the news. Josie Rourke (who recently scored with Shakespeare's Coriolanus) directs; young playwright James Graham (best known for his surprise parliamentary hit, This House) writes. AD Donmar, London WC2 (0844 871 7624), 10 April to 31 May. Architecture Battle of the towers of London With plans for novelty towers shaped like a can of ham, a knife and a rolled-up napkin set to join the Gherkin in the City of London, the table is almost laid for a surreal dinner party in the sky. This year, two of its biggest guests will finally join the party, with the completion of the Cheesegrater, by Richard Rogers, and Rafael ViÃ±oly's Walkie-Scorchie "fryscraper". With the latter undergoing an expensive retrofit to try to banish the lethal "death ray", will it be safe to walk along Eastcheap this summer? Oliver Wainwright Shimmering apparition â¦ Glasgow School of Art. Glasgow School of Art by Steven Holl Looming over Charles Rennie Mackintosh's original Glasgow School of Art building, American architect Steven Holl's new extension to the college has been designed as a shimmering apparition of greenish glass in contrast to the heavy masonry structure across the road. A spiralling sequence of studios will climb up through the building, arranged around "driven voids" to bring light down deep into the floors below. The different departments will all be connected by a continuous zig-zagging route designed, says the architect, to encourage "creative abrasion". OW A House for Essex The final project of mischievous architecture practice FAT, which recently announced its breakup, this surreal hybrid between a Thai wat and an Essex barn will be one of their strangest projects yet. Conceived as a scaled-up gingerbread house, it will be decked out with ceramic mouldings and tapestries by Grayson Perry, along with a line of his sculptures on the top of the roof. It will be the latest building in Alain de Botton's programme of Living Architecture holiday rentals â and promises to be the kookiest of the lot. OW Classical Master of the Queen's Music Peter Maxwell Davies's self-imposed 10-year limit on his stint as Master of the Queen's Music ends in March, a few months before his 80th birthday. There's no stand-out candidate to succeed him, for it's hard to imagine most of the other leading British composers of today writing the ceremonial music required. Mark-Anthony Turnage might be one possible candidate, though; others could be Judith Weir, Michael Berkeley or Jonathan Dove. Before that appointment, though, the LSO has a major Maxwell Davies premiere, when Antonio Pappano conducts what Davies says will be his last symphony, the Tenth. Andrew Clements Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), 1 February. Thebans In an age when too many composers are encouraged to compose their first operas at far too young an age, Julian Anderson has taken his time before embarking on one. Thebans, with a libretto by playwright Frank McGuinness, based upon Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone plays, has been gestating for some years since ENO first offered Anderson a commission. It's directed by Pierre Audi, intendant of the Netherlands Opera and once a familiar figure in London contemporary music, here making his ENO debut. AC Coliseum, London WC2 (020-7845 9300), 3 May to 3 June. Art Sensing Spaces Architecture is not just about walls and doors and iconic skylines. It is about what's inside a shape â the volumes that a building contains and how the human body moves through them. From labyrinths to pods, from vast open halls to underground swimming pools, architecture can craft powerful spatial experiences. This exhibition uses multimedia installations to make the most avant-garde spaces of 21st-century architecture come alive. Jonathan Jones Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000), 25 January to 6 April. Art as Therapy Author Alain de Botton believes museums should change lives. This exhibition applies that ideal â the theme of his book Art as Therapy â to the great collections of the Rijksmuseum. Can Rembrandt's Nightwatch help you deal with a fear of the dark? Does Vermeer's Milkmaid suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder? The exhibition no doubt asks far more profound questions than these as it aims to show how artistic masterpieces can heal the pain of modern life. JJ Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (0031 20 6747 000), 25 April to 7 September. Digital Revolution Digital culture is the future that's already here. But is it art? That old chestnut of a question is likely to be raised in new forms by this survey of how the digital revolution is changing everything from music (will.i.am is a participant) to cinema and interactive art (represented by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer among others). Perhaps the most fascinating field for debate is gaming, which is both addictive and genuinely creative in the complex imaginary worlds it reveals. If digital life is art, is the artist an individual or a crowd? JJ Barbican, London EC1 (020-7638 8891), 3 July to 14 September. â¢ This article was amended on 6 January 2014. An earlier version said Union, which opens at the Lyceum in Edinburgh in March, was written by Mark Thomson. He is the director; the playwright is Tim Barrow.

â¢ A headline (Last chance to find Madeleine: police to focus on 38 suspects identified in review, 5 July, page 3) was wrong to describe the 38 "persons of interest" that emerged from the Metropolitan police's two-year review of evidence in the Madeleine McCann case as suspects; they are potential suspects, which is how the article itself described them. â¢ The byline picture published with an article by Fawaz Gerges (The real danger is that the army is once again political powerbroker, 5 July, page 36) was not of him but of Dani Dayan, author of a different comment piece published on 8 June. Apologies to both men. â¢ The Experience column in last Saturday's Weekend magazine (I punched a bear, page 14) described an encounter on a beach between a family and an attacking brown bear. An editing error placed the encounter in Arizona, when in fact it took place much further north in Alaska. As a reader pointed out, brown bears are not found in Arizona. â¢ An article about a cycle journey from Hastings to Bexhill (A gentle roll along the promenade, 22 June, page 16, Britain's Best Bike Rides) said Hastings pier had been struck by lightning and closed for good. It burned down in 2010, but the cause was not lightning, and there are plans to rebuild it. Also, Hastings and Bexhill are in East Sussex, not West Sussex as a heading on page 18 of the same supplement said. â¢ A review of Evie Wyld's novel All the Birds, Singing, misnamed one of its characters, Lloyd, as Ralph (The scars on her back, 29 June, page 14, Review). â¢ Evo Morales: plane rerouting over Edward Snowden 'a provocation' was corrected because, as the result of a misreading of the edited agency story about President Morales's speech, a subheading on the article stated that the president regretted offering Snowden asylum. He did not.

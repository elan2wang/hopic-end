Suppose Polly Jane Harvey could rule the Daily Mail for day, while Paul Dacre spent 24 hours in the chair at the Guardian. The two papers would, however briefly, change. PJ might lock Quentin Letts in the loo for the duration; Paul would probably find the cross-currents of debate and investigation a tad complex. But, in either case, you'd sense instant upheaval â just as Today listeners found Harvey's three hours a bit of a morning jolt. Take in a few words from Julian Assange (plus John Pilger, Rowan Williams and the last British resident in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, among others). Does that merit the cries of "Drivel!" and "Leftie tosh" recorded by the Mail? Or the predictable lectures about fairness and balance from MPs? Can the BBC's Assange decision â giving airtime to "such a grubby man" â really be deemed "cringe-making and unpatriotic"? There are bigger questions here. One is where public service broadcasting sits in an exploding world of digital innovation. The BBC can be assailed for a direct word of WikiLeaking via the Ecuador embassy; Channel Four News can be roasted for a Christmas message from Edward Snowden. The complacent assumption is that both somehow lie beyond the frail boundaries of consensus. To hear Assange declare that keeping "a person ignorant is to place him in a cage" seemingly shivers too many timbers. Yet if either message were printed on a newspaper page, or relayed on a newspaper website, there'd be little fuss and almost no comment. Newspapers, traditionally, can make waves and bust consensuses. Broadcasters have to tread far more warily. But â as Harvey's day out demonstrates â that's increasingly ridiculous. Consensus lets the former head of MI5 or Norman Tebbit edit Today, but erupts over 180 minutes of PJ. Assange's theme is essentially Dacre's own view of secret justice in family courts. Nothing he says is particularly inflammatory. Perhaps Pilger sometimes has a rhetorical attitude to humble statistics, but hey! he was writing for the Guardian 24 hours after his Today turn. Over the past few months, ever since the Entwistle and Savile sagas, the BBC has hired or promoted print journalists to lead and talk it into a new era. James Harding, ex-editor of the Times, is head of news, with his old deputy, Keith Blackmore, as managing editor. Ian Katz, deputy editor of the Guardian, now leads Newsnight. Kamal Ahmed from the Sunday Telegraph is the new BBC business editor as Robert Peston (ex-FT) takes over economics coverage. All are accomplished journalists, not ideologues. ("I took the view that as a young journalist I couldn't be a member of a political party," Peston told the Observer last Sunday). But they need their editorial freedom â yes, their press freedom â too. The facile thing as digital whirls forward is to believe that freedom, as interpreted from some editorial chair or other, comes too easily marked "print people only". On the contrary, it matters just as much, if not more, in a brave new technological world where the number of words on call doubles every two years, and where the TV set in your front room may receive 700 channels at the click of a remote. Defending it means defending the BBC as well as putting the boot in. Freedom means letting Polly Harvey have her say. Freedom involves opening the cages, not trying to wave an old rulebook and slam them shut. A woman publisher's work is never done If you're a woman in journalism, dreaming of life as publisher of a renowned newspaper, dream on with Katharine Weymouth, publisher of the Washington Post, talking to her local lifestyle magazine: " I wake up at 5.50, go for a 2-mile run with my friend Carolyn ... come home, make breakfasts for the [three] kids and lunch for one, take the dogs out, feed the dogs, put drops in one dog's eyes, drive the kids to three different drop-off points and get to work by 9.30â¦ "At the endâ¦ I go home for dinner with the kids, catch up with them, make sure they've done their homework and put them to bedâ¦Otherwise, like every single parent, I pay the bills, run the house, fill out school and camp forms, make doctor appointments and play dates, schedule activities, buy groceries, cook, put furniture together â and I'm not too bad with a cordless drill."

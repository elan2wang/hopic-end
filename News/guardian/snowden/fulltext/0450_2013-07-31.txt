There is a certain kind of advocate of peace it is hard to take entirely seriously, yet who nevertheless cannot be dismissed. People like Garry Davis, Abe Nathan, and John Lennon take the whole world to their bosom, in the words of EB White. Davis, who died last week, was a flamboyant member of that small tribe of men and women, both irritating and inspiring, who vow to rise above tribe. He discarded his US passport in 1948, travelled thereafter on his own "world passport", and issued many thousands of such documents, recently sending them to Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. As with Abe Nathan's missions in the Middle East, the practical effect was minimal, but such people neverthless change the chemistry of things. Even John Lennon and Yoko Ono, tongue in cheek announcing that their virtual nation of Nutopia would "have no laws other than cosmic", made a difference. Nationalism needs challenging, so let the gadflies gad.

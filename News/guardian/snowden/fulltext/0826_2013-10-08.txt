Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian â¢ All quiet on the energy front from the government's perspective, as we reported yesterday. Obviously, there's a lot going on. But ministers seem determined to keep quiet about it. What did the energy minister say when he met with frackers Cuadrilla, we asked? Can't tell you â there is no record, his department said. But the truth of it is that MPs don't fare much better. Lord Browne, the government's lead business adviser to the civil service, former BP chairman, and now chairman of Cuadrilla, seems to have the run of Whitehall, so it was reasonable of Hemsworth MP Jon Trickett to ask for details of what he has been up to. Earlier this year the MP asked for a list of Browne's engagements for 2012. Like us, he didn't get anywhere. If we told you what he was up to behind the scenes, said Francis Maude, he wouldn't be able to make the contribution that he makes. Too much transparency would "enable inferences to be drawn about the nature of his contribution. This would erode confidence that his advice would remain confidential and would make it more difficult for him to perform his role effectively. This would therefore prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs." Basically, we can't tell you but it's for your own good. When Sir Humphrey parroted this stuff on Yes Minister we thought it was comedy. â¢ With an election coming down the track, PM Dave is making nice with all sorts of people. Gladhanding the faithful but also making the odd trek behind enemy lines. Thus last night saw him at the Daily Mirror's Pride of Britain Awards, handing out a gong to deserving folk from the NHS and sounding unusually grateful to the Mirror for being lovely enough to have invited him. Still, the love will only stretch so far. At about the same time last night, PM Dave was to be seen being interviewed on The Agenda talk show by ITV's Tom Bradby, and complaining about the Sunday Mirror rifling through his bins. â¢ And from the Evening Standard, proof that PM Dave, for all his faults, is always looking ahead. "The prime minister promised a 'truly national commemoration' to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war in 2014, Armistice Day in 2018, and the dates of major battles in between." Now that's forward planning. â¢ With much discussion about the power of the press, a question: what has been the effect of the many disclosures from uber-whistleblower Edward Snowden, via the Guardian and collaborators such as the New York Times? From 6 June to 4 September, reports the transparency site Muckrock, requests to the National Security Agency using freedom of information legislation increased 1,054% compared with the same period in 2012. "In that three-month span, the agency received 3,382 public records requests. For comparison, the NSA received just 293 requests over the same period in 2012," says Muckrock. That's holding power to account. No wonder the snoopers are angry. Doubt he is having quite the same effect in Putin's Russia, though. â¢ Finally, Tony Blair tried his hand in 1998, but what need have we for a US-style state of the union address when so many are willing to pronounce from afar about the way of things on our small island. The other day it was the rough and tumble footballer turned Hollywood hard man Vincent "Vinnie" Jones. Too many immigrants, said Vinnie. "It's not the country I grew up in." Also keen to chart our degradation we now have Lemmy, the man who put the spine into Spinal Tap, chief hellraiser from heavy metal band Motorhead. "I miss the England I was born in, but I don't miss what it is today," he tells Classic Rock magazine, from his vantage point of LA. "Everything has gone, hasn't it? It's fucked. It's awful. They're taxing everything, everything is so expensive. It's shit." Still, context is all. Perhaps he was grouchy, for time has not been uniformly kind to Lemmy. In his pomp he drank a bottle of Jack Daniels every day. "I stopped drinking Jack Daniels and Coke," he says. "The sugar in the Coke wasn't good for my diabetes." The body tells you these things.

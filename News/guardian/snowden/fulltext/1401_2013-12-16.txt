Home secretary Theresa May answers questions from MPs. Photograph: PA MPs were reminded of the demonic cruelty perpetrated against its own people by the communist regime in North Korea where the uncle of the boy ruler, Kim Jong-un, has been executed for plotting to seize power and enjoying a depraved life that includes gambling and page three girls. Did it make MPs grateful that under the relatively benign autocracy of David Cameron plotters such as Boris Johnson and Nick Clegg go unpunished, and that voters are still free to refuse mass indoctrination by the regime's own shadowy strongman, Uncle Rupert? No it did not. Far from being either cowed or grateful a small, politically motivated band of them took the home secretary hostage in retaliation for her refusal to hand over a suspected security threat, M15 chief Andrew Parker. They then interrogated her for two hours in a vain search for information they'd hoped to get from him. Time and time again members of the notorious home affairs select committee asked Theresa May the same questions, hoping she would crack. Does she want to impose a cap on the free movement of workers from the EU? Not right this minute. Is the Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger, a menace for publishing Edward Snowden's datamining leaks? Definitely, though May was unable to say quite why, except that Parker had said so. And why won't you let Parker give his own explanation to them as well as to the intelligence and security committee? This was a tough one because even Rusbridger-baiting Tories such as Michael Ellis were offended by it. May kept saying it is because that's the way it's done, not because the intelligence committee agrees the questions (and possibly the answers) in advance. Perhaps Rusbridger is right, Ellis suggested in an attempt to get her to say something interesting. It failed. Dressed in an expensive wool suit, the Vivienne Westwood of the coalition survived her ordeal with only a few bruises, though she may need therapy over her treatment by the committee's chairman, Keith Vaz. When May said Rusbridger's misconduct was "by definition obvious", Vaz purred "it may be to you" but he wanted evidence. When she complained he was "dancing on the head of a pin", he said: " I'm not dancing.'' Shame! Publicity-hungry Vaz could win Strictly Come Dancing alone. Pique, it was definitely pique. If Vaz had a white cat he'd have stroked it. But the maddest moment came when Labour's Ian Austin asked how she had come to appoint as a responsible Home Office minister a "fantasist" who believes the police, government, security services and the Women's Institute (I made that one up) all conspired to murder weapons scientist Dr David Kelly? This could only be Lib Dem Norman Baker, the man who makes M15's Parker sound normal. Conspiracy theorists believe Baker was dumped on May to ruin her career, as a punishment for plotting against Dave. As vengeance goes it is not in North Korea's league, but is not bad for Whitehall. May sweetly called Baker an excellent minister. "Presumably you send him a Christmas card," said torturer-in-chief, Vaz. "I believe I sent you one too," she answered. When MPs turned to the real thing â North Korea â they angrily demanded action against the rogue regime in Pyongyang, not easy for a cash-strapped nation 5,000 miles away and with only 28 soldiers and four grounded helicopters available for a taskforce. Far more menacing they also want the BBC to join the attack, even Tory MPs who usually see the Beeb as Kim Jong-un's propaganda wing. Some MPs want the BBC to divert its executives redundo slush fund to pump out World Service radio news in Korean. Others demanded that BBC drama, science and nature programmes be used to undermine Kim's regime. St David of Attenborough? Dara Ã³ Briain's Science Club? Downton Abbey? Haven't they suffered enough?

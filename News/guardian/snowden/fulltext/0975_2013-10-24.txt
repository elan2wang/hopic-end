Garbled â¦ Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall in Closed Circuit. Closed Circuit Production year: 2013 Country: Rest of the world Cert (UK): 15 Runtime: 96 mins Directors: John Crowley Cast: Anne-Marie Duff, Ciaran Hinds, Eric Bana, Jim Broadbent, Julia Stiles, Rebecca Hall, Riz Ahmed More on this film See if this film is playing near you UK postcode: Alarming news for those who missed the recent Edward Snowden revelations. There's a camera on every corner, we're all being watched, and the security state may actually threaten our liberty as much as protect it. That's the stentorian message of the makeweight Closed Circuit, in which Rebecca Hall and Eric Bana play defence lawyers who stumble upon a potential MI5 conspiracy in the wake of a terrorist bombing in Borough Market. The whole cast is wound up, they all have secrets to conceal. But John Crowley's thriller provides too shallow a vessel for this murky subject matter. It plays as cut-price Le CarrÃ©; a recording of a recording of superior films. The picture is fuzzy, and the plot becomes garbled.

Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald speaks to reporters at his hotel in Hong Kong. Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP Glenn Greenwald has had a busy week. On Wednesday, Greenwald â backed up by a team of Guardian reporters â published a series of stories now widely known as the #NSAfiles. On Sunday, the NSA whistleblower who leaked the secret documents to the Guardian, revealed himself as Edward Snowden on the Guardian. Greenwald has since been at the center of many media reports â including a controversial New York Times profile. You, his readers, knew him long before he was in the national spotlight. Since 2005, Glenn Greenwald has written about national security and civil liberties. You've communicated with him by email. You've sparred in the comment section. Maybe you've known him since his Salon days. Or perhaps you're an old-timer, and can quickly volunteer the name of the blog Greenwald set up in 2005 when he was still working as a corporate litigator: Unclaimed Territory. As journalists from around the globe try to tell Glenn's story, we're asking you, his community, to weigh in. Your responses to the questions below will be used to build a profile of Glenn on the Guardian. We're asking you to respond very briefly to our questions so make sure to choose your words carefully!

Australia and Indonesia need to “come to some arrangement” about how intelligence is used, Indonesian vice president Boediono has said. Dr Boediono said the public in Indonesia was “concerned” about recent spying revelations. “I think we must look forward to come to some arrangement which guarantees that intelligence from each side is not used against the other,” he said. “There must be a system.” Guardian Australia reported recently that Australia was spying on Indonesia at the UN climate change conference in 2007, according documents obtained by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. And Fairfax Media used documents leaked to German news magazine Der Spiegel by Snowden to show that Australia was gathering intelligence from listening posts across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Indonesia. Indonesia reacted strongly, with foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, saying spying was “just not cricket`’ and that he had sought clarification from foreign minister Julie Bishop on this important issue of “trust”. He suggested intelligence cooperation with Australia on the contentious issues of people smuggling and terrorism could be reviewed in light of the reports. But Dr Boediono, who met Prime Minister Tony Abbott Wednesday, took a more conciliatory stance, saying Australia and Indonesia needed to “focus on long term mutual interests” rather than be “swayed by daily or monthly events.” The vice president was answering questions after delivering a lecture at the Australian National University.

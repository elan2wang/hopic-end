The Independent's Ed Snowden photo (click for full cover image) Amol Rajan's first Independent as editor briefly had a front-page picture headed "Snowden arrives in Moscow"... which wasn't of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. D'oh! As noted by Monkey's Guardian night desk colleague Simon Ricketts late on Sunday, picture agency Barcroft Media fessed up to the caption snafu in the digital only proof and it was changed before the first edition went to print. While seeking in vain for a reference to this opening night embarrassment on Amol's Twitter feed, Monkey did however discover that MediaGuardian and other publications have apparently been wide of the mark in describing him as the first "non-white" editor of a UK national newspaper. He graciously retweeted a Prospect piece pointing out that Rachel Sassoon Beer beat him to that particularly accolade... by a 120-odd years ago. â¢ This article was amended on Tuesday 25 June, to remove reference to the picture error being published in the Independent's first print edition.

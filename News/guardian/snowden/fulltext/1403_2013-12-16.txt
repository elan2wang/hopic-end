Happy Christmas from Sir John Sawers and his chums at MI6. â¢ Just a week until Christmas. A time of great celebration. And, of course, an opportunity. For one of the perks of being Santa must be the opportunity to enter people's homes. The occupants are asleep, so there is time to nose around: look at who's sent cards, flick through the mail, note the books they read. Crazy not to utilise the information-gathering potential. That is why we find our newest hero â "Secret Santa" â on the front of Christmas cards produced for Sir John Sawers, chief of the secret intelligence services, ie head of MI6. There are five shadowy figures, men and women in black raincoats and black sunglasses, and then there is Santa, garish in red but able to go undetected during the festive season. Able to respond to the Guardian and the bothersome revelations of Edward Snowden. Ho, ho, ho; Santa keeps us safe. â¢ Yes, Christmas is coming. A time of compassion for fellow humans. Barbara Amiel, the writer and wife of that great wealth regenerator, Conrad Black, goes all soppy writing about the closure of a Heinz plant in Ontario, throwing thousands out of work. It follows the takeover of the company by US billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Amiel recalls how her own father was "laid off" in Canada in the 1950s; "parents' and children's faces grey with worry". Still, one can't get sentimental. "You can't expect to be the fourth-richest man in the world if you don't make bloodless decisions," she says of Buffett. And "anyway, a lot of widows and orphans are probably invested in [Buffett's] Berkshire Hathaway stock so one man's misfortune is another's good deal". It's a wonderful life, ain't it Babs? â¢ As public relations disasters go, the saga of the Rev Paul Flowers, the former head of the Co-operative Bank, is hard to beat. The parliamentary humiliation, the allegations of sex and drugs. Any organisation would struggle to keep things on an even keel. And so it falls to the Co-operative sponsored MPs to remind everyone of the sort of work for which the movement can claim credit. "I know that recent events at the Co-operative Bank are of grave concern to all of us in the co-operative movement," writes MP Stephen Doughty to members. Many will feel, he says, an obvious "fear that those unprecedented events risk overshadowing the huge contribution that we all know co-operatives and mutuals are making to ordinary people across our country". Then, perhaps, he pushes his luck. "As ever, I'd also encourage you to think about how you might be able to support the party financially, either by donating or leaving a legacy." Never let a crisis go to waste. â¢ More on Lord Deben, the former John Selwyn Gummer, chair of the independent committee on climate change (CCC), who took heavy weekend fire from the Mail on Sunday. Still, if his stance on climate change attracts ire from the doubters, he gives as good as he gets. Last week at the Christmas reception for the parliamentary renewable and alternative energy group (Praseg), the Tory grandee and former environment secretary used the occasion to put the boot into former Tory cabinet colleague and former chancellor Lord Lawson â who runs an anti-climate change institute. He would keep making sweeping statements on CCC reports which he had not read and did not wish to understand, said Deben. Rising to his theme, he turned his fire on the Conservative Central Office, saying it kept using the wrong figures on the cost of implementing climate change mitigation policies dreamed up by the Taxpayers' Alliance when the CCC has published the basis for its fully costed figures. No matter, he said, for the CCC will continue to preach the climate change message â despite the work of deniers he likened to tobacco companies creating doubt about the risk of smoking. It's God's work, or the "missionary position", as he called it. â¢ Finally, he's sad and he's bad, but there is awful news for the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The previously loyal Morning Star appears to have abandoned him. "No one could confuse this state of affairs with socialism or any other system to which workers might aspire," it says. He won't stand for that. He'll cancel any subscriptions. Twitter: @hugh_muir

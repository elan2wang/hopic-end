Alan Rusbridger giving evidence to the home affairs committee in the Commons about Edward Snowden's National Security Agency revelations. Photograph: PA Had we been told on the home affairs committee that your editor was not particularly keen, for understandable reasons, to give oral evidence to us (Report, 4 December), I would have opposed his being asked to come along; if necessary, the issue would no doubt have been put to a vote, whatever the outcome might have been. As it happened, despite deeply hostile questions from one member in particular, Alan Rusbridger put the case very well indeed for what the Guardian has done, in common with the New York Times and other papers, in publishing some, and only some, of Edward Snowden's revelations. He certainly made the valid point that the sheer amount of extensive intelligence and surveillance carried out, the extent of which was not known before, has led to an ongoing debate about the effectiveness of the existing parliamentary oversights of the security agencies. The point put to the editor whether he loves his country was somewhat inappropriate, to say the least, and I was heard to respond: "How do you reply to such a question?" Though it was obviously far removed from my Labour colleague's mind, that sort of question does remind one of the post-1945 US congressional inquiries into alleged internal subversion and treachery. It would, I think, be generally agreed that the home affairs committee has over a period of time produced excellent and informative reports, written by highly professional staff, and largely based on evidence given to us. However, there is a danger, and not limited to this particular committee, that the quest for evidence and information on various topics may also be seen as an opportunity for regular media publicity. If that was to become the impression, and I hope not, it would certainly diminish the reputation of select committees. David Winnick MP Labour, Walsall North

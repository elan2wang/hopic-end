The latest ABC digital audit, released today, confirms that the Guardian website recorded its best ever web traffic in June 2013 for the fourth consecutive month, reaching over 84 million unique browsers for the first time. The figure, which beats the previous record of 82.9 million set in May this year, saw month-on-month traffic increase by 2.4% while year-on-year figures rose by nearly 40%. Average daily traffic is also up 4.7% from last month, with 4.8 million daily average unique browsers - up 41% since the same period last year. It was the fifth record month in a row for the Guardian's mobile site, which was seen by 24 million monthly unique browsers in June - an 6.1% increase since the previous month. This record figure demonstrates the continued growth of the mobile site following its responsive design relaunch in November 2012. The top stories this month were the NSA files, which dominated the site for much of June. The article in which Edward Snowden identified himself became our most popular article ever on the website, receiving 3.7 million page views and saw the day it was published, Monday 10 June, reach a record high in traffic in a single day. In total, the Guardian's NSA content was viewed by 8.8 million unique browsers across desktop and mobile. David Pemsel, Chief Commercial Officer at Guardian News & Media said: "June was an incredible month for the Guardian. Our explosive NSA revelations made headlines in the US - one article becoming our most popular ever - helping to drive traffic to an overall record high. Our editorial success provides us with a great commercial opportunity and as we prepare to move to a new global domain, theguardian.com, never before have we been in such a strong position to offer commercial partners around the world access to our engaged global audience." -ends-

11.15am GMT Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world, as controversy over revelations leaked by the whistleblower continue to make headlines. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about – and any new areas you'd like to read more about. • The Home Office's head of counter-terrorism yesterday revived his fight to secure the return of the "snooper's charter" legislation, insisting that the government's spy listening centre GCHQ has never collected the communications data required by Britain's police and security services under the ditched bill, as Alan Travis reports. Charles Farr, the head of the office of security and counter-terrorism, told MPs on Tuesday he had learned new things about particular GCHQ operations from the Guardian's disclosures but not about its capabilities. He said he had seen material about the US National Security Agency that had been completely new to him but it was information he had not needed to know. He told the Commons home affairs select committee there was "no doubt" disclosures about GCHQ's capabilities based on Edward Snowden's leaks had made them less effective but refused to provide any evidence, arguing that to do so would make a bad situation worse … The Snowden documents detailed how GCHQ's Tempora programme scoops up and stores for up to 30 days the personal communications data flowing out of Britain to the US computer servers of companies such Facebook, Google and Twitter. The "snooper's charter" would require phone and internet companies to collect and store all UK communications data for 12 months for access by the police and security services. You can read my live blog on his session at the Commons home affairs select committee here. • Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, is currently visiting Australia and has been taking readers’ questions. Here’s some of what he said about the Snowden affair. Meanwhile in the US yesterday Guardian journalists involved in reporting the Snowden stories have also been answering readers’ questions. Here are a couple of samples: @jamesrbuk Is the process of mass surveillance and gov data retention reversible? Is the genie out the bottle? #myNSAquestion— Charlotte Henry (@charlotteahenry) November 12, 2013 @charlotteahenry It's too late to reverse the technology: NSA and 5-Eyes will always be capable of what they are today (and more) (1/2)— James Ball (@jamesrbuk) November 12, 2013 @charlotteahenry But it is possible to restrict those capabilities through changes to law, legal challenge, or to strengthen oversight (2/2)— James Ball (@jamesrbuk) November 12, 2013 #MyNSAQuestion how effective really is the NSA surveillance at stopping or helping to stop terror plots?— Ian Sussna (@WanganSussna) November 12, 2013 @WanganSussna We donât have an independent answer. NSA says it stopped 54 plots but can't cite clear *domestic* case...(1/3) #MyNSAQuestion— Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) November 12, 2013 @WanganSussna (2/3) stopped by bulk collection. FISA Court lacks ability to verify. But even critics like Sen. Wyden... #MyNSAQuestion— Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) November 12, 2013 @WanganSussna ...donât dispute the utility of foreign surveillance for counterterrorism, broadly speaking. #MyNSAQuestion— Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) November 12, 2013 I'll have live coverage of all developments here throughout the day.

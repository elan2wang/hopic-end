Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters It is irrelevant whether David Miranda is a journalist, in the employ of a journalist, or just the friend of a journalist. Journalists do not have special rights when it comes to trafficking in illegal activities (David Miranda's detention made it public: the threat to journalism is real, 21 August). None of us (with the possible exception of certain Guardian reporters) know the details of what is contained in the documents stolen from the National Security Agency by Edward Snowden. Based on the agitated state of the NSA, and by the reactions of Mr Snowden, these items likely contain information that fits into the category of espionage. Whether that information is dangerous is probably not something that you, or I, or the Guardian, should decide. I don't know who might be best suited to decide this sort of thing but we should accept that it's not you, me, or the Guardian. If we can assume that there was dependable knowledge available that Mr Miranda was carrying information from Mr Snowden, and as Mr Snowden is known to traffic in information that is considered dangerous by at least two of the world's leading intelligence agencies, shouldn't we expect that those appointed to protect us might want a closer look at Mr Miranda's laptop? WOn the subject of schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, the "war on terror" has allowed far too many of our liberties to be taken. At first we thought these would be temporary measures until the al-Qaida jihadists were dealt with. Then we were reminded that the world is a continuously dangerous place, and we wouldn't be getting our airports back any time soon. But, disturbingly, we are losing more and more of the due process of law. It's slightly hollow to compare Mr Miranda's treatment with the weird state of affairs in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, but they are cut from the same sort of shameful cloth. If Mr Miranda has broken the law, he should be arrested. I'm not familiar with espionage laws, but it seems reasonable that such a charge would allow for the seizure of his files as evidence, whether he is a journalist or not. And that includes his thumb drives, Mr Rusbridger. TR Murray London â¢âIt is unfortunate that parliament is in recess just as the storm around the Snowden documents rages (The press must not yield to this state intimidation, Simon Jenkins, 21 August). There is no redress for the citizen to use the democratic process and bring the executive to account or challenge all the political parties to make a statement. There may have been a debate about GCHQ specifically and the NSA in general but hardly a mention of the largest intelligence-gathering US base at NSA Menwith Hill, which also has GCHQ personnel present. Rest assured, Simon Jenkins, that when parliament starts off again we will be asking questions and "bloody well" publishing the debate. Lindis Percy Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases â¢âIt is the height of naivety to believe that police will not routinely abuse any powers granted to them for special purposes. After all, photographing a police minibus parked in a disabled parking spot while the officers ate sandwiches has brought a threat of prosecution under the Terrorism Act unless the photos were deleted; and the demand that demonstrators remove head coverings, regardless of suspicion of involvement in any of the actions supposedly required to justify such a demand, is now routine. Jon Fanning Associate lecturer, Open University â¢âBy accepting Mr Snowden's documents, the Guardian is condoning the actions of any of its employees who may choose to leak the company's secrets to interested parties. If you were remotely interested in transparency, you would reveal the exact nature of your dealings with Mr Miranda, who is neither a journalist nor on your payroll. Your editor has equated his detention with state persecution of journalists, but he has chosen to continue publishing highly sensitive stolen information regardless of the consequences. Unlike the police, he has no duty to protect national security. Dr Christina Julios London â¢âIt's deplorable but not hugely surprising that schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000 gives power to the police and others to question those who are detained. What is truly remarkable is that, as your correspondent paraphrased it, "it is an arrestable offence to refuse to answer any question" (Letters, 20 August). This may appear to be the result of the schedule, under which (para 5) a detained person must "give the officer any information in his possession which the officer requests" and (para 18) the person commits an offence if he "wilfully fails to comply with a duty" imposed under this schedule. But the power to question (by para 2) is conferred for the purpose of determining whether the individual appears to be a person who "is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism" (schedule 40(1)(b)). Certainly, someone against whom these powers are used is in a vulnerable position, and abuse of authority is all too likely. But unless and until the higher courts interpret these extraordinary provisions, it must not be assumed that every refusal to answer questions will be a criminal offence. For one thing, to refuse may not be to act "wilfully". For another, questions that are plainly outside the stated purpose of questioning need not be answered. Moreover, the Human Rights Act, s 3, requires the courts where this is possible to interpret the schedule in a manner that is compatible with the individual's convention rights. AW Bradley Abingdon, Oxfordshire â¢âThe home secretary, Theresa May, has told the BBC that she "was briefed in advance that there was a possibility of a port stop of the sort that took place" and that "decisions as to whether or not to stop somebody or to arrest somebody are not for me as home secretary, they are for the police". And we now know that Downing Street was also informed in advance, presumably at the same time as Washington. The thing is, who told the Metropolitan police that David Miranda was flying into Heathrow, en route from Berlin to Brazil, and why did they think he had "highly sensitive stolen information that could help terrorists"? If, as Downing Street says, it does not direct police investigations and neither does the home secretary, who did? Dan Tanzey Cleveleys, Lancashire

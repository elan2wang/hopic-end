5.22pm GMT A number of British MPs from all three parties have spoken out in response to the White House review panel's report into NSA surveillance. • Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader and a member of the UK's intelligence and security committee (ISC) which oversees the security services, said the report should be "required reading" in the Britain as well as America. • Labour's David Winnick, a member of the Commons home affairs committee that is also currently assessing counter-terrorism, said the NSA report "will undoubtedly lead to some of the work undertaken by GCHQ surveillance being further questioned". • Lib Dem Julian Huppert said Britain's oversight of the security services was "very, very thin", and said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of the ISC, should use the US report as an opportunity to strengthen his committee and make it more transparent. • His fellow Lib Dem Tim Farron urged party members to back a digital bill of rights that would restrict mass surveillance by GCHQ. • Tory David Davis said the US report had "hit the nail right on the head" and pointed out that the report had said that bulk collection of telephone data had not been necessary to stop any terrorists. "Since they work so closely with our people we must assume that applies to us" too, he said. • His fellow Conservative Rory Stewart, a former diplomat, said the White House review added to pressure in Britain to strengthen oversight of the intelligence agencies. • But David Cameron's spokesman said the prime minister's view of the security service controversies sparked by Edward Snowden's leaks to the Guardian remained "unchanged", despite the US report. That's it from me. Thanks for all the comments.

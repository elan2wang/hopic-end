Photograph: Brian Witte/AP The father of the girlfriend of Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower who leaked classified documents about US surveillance operations, has said she is holding on after she blogged about how alone she felt in the face of the controversy. The day after Snowden identified himself as the source of the leaks, Lindsay Mills, a 28-year-old performance artist, apparently wrote: "My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass â¦ at the moment all I can feel is alone." Her father, Jonathan Mills, told reporters on Tuesday evening outside his home in Laurel, Maryland, that his daughter was doing "as well as could be expected, and that's all I have to say". He described 29-year-old Snowden as "very nice. Shy, and reserved". "He's always had strong convictions of right and wrong, and it kind of makes sense. But still shocked," Mills said, describing his reaction to the news about Snowden. Asked if he had a message for Snowden, Mills said: "Just wish him good luck and he's got my love." Mills said he had texted his daughter but did not know where she was. The last time he saw her was two months ago, when she came to visit for a week, he added. Lindsay Mills has been dating Snowden for four or five years. The authenticity of her blog, subtitled "Adventures of a world-travelling, pole-dancing super hero", which was seen by the Guardian before it was taken down on Tuesday, could not be verified. Snowden had previously told the Guardian his girlfriend was called Lindsay. He left Hawaii for Hong Kong three weeks ago, telling his girlfriend he had to be away for a while, but being deliberately vague about the reason for his disappearance.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, will attend a meeting of the National Security Council chaired by the prime minister on Afghanistan, Syria and Iran. Government officials insisted the invitation to Tuesday's meeting was not an attempt to persuade a sceptical Miliband to back the export of arms to the Syrian opposition. Labour has not yet explicitly opposed the export of UK arms to the divided opposition, but has repeatedly indicated it is not yet persuaded of the wisdom of such a course. It will be the second time David Cameron has asked Miliband to attend a meeting of the NSC, with a previous invitation in 2011 at the time of the Franco-UK action in Libya. In 2010 Cameron asked the temporary Labour leader, Harriet Harman, to a similar meeting. Cameron regards it as important to try to build a cross-party consensus on foreign policy as much as possible. Downing Street said no significance should be read into the timing of Miliband's meeting, or that it was a specific attempt to persuade Labour to back the arming of the rebels. The prime minister's spokesman said the discussions at the meeting would be private, and Miliband would be free to raise any issue he likes, including the ministerial oversight of the security services in the light of allegations made by Edward Snowden in the Guardian that the security services were involved in a more widespread surveillance operation than has previously been admitted. The prime minister's spokesman said there was no evidence that the security services had overstepped the mark, or had in any way breached the rules on parliamentary oversight. He said the prime minister was still waiting for a report from the intelligence and security committee chaired by Sir Malcolm Rifkind.

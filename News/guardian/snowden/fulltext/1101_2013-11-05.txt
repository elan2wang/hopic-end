Amazing, inspiring and a teeny bit irritating â¦ Gareth Malone leads P&O choir members. Photograph: Pete Dadds/Twenty Twenty/BBC Here's something to maybe fill the baking void: singing. Not The X Factor, but middle-class talent television, for the Guardian reader: The Choir: Sing While You Work (BBC2) with Gareth Malone. Corporate glee. Actually It's a shame the Guardian isn't in it (and you have to be to win it, innit). There is a choir here â the Guardian Angels, they call themselves; you can here them practising on a Wednesday lunchtime. What would they do in this? A version of The Snowman theme, rewritten to be about Edward Snowden? We're Spying in the Air â¦ Or some kind of NWA/NSA gangsta rap, Straight Outta Kings Place. Or something better. Anyway, the Guardian's not in it, P&O is. Surely they should do My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. Or anything by Roxy Music. I'm thinking of the singer. Oh, for the audition they're doing Sailing by Rod Stewart, drearily. "We are sailing," growls Grant, the burly quartermaster. Gareth tells him he sounds like a drain, and he's not lying. But Gareth picks Grant because he wants them to sound like sailors. Maybe Grant should gargle drain cleaner, before the competition proper. Gareth has grown a beard. It makes him less of a choirboy, more of a grown-up; maybe it will give him more authority over these sailors. He also has a bowtie and a pair of yellow trousers and has bounded cheerily aboard the company's flagship Spirit of Britain, prowling the decks in search of singers. It's a kind of reverse pressgang â snatching crew members from their ship to take them ashore to join a choir. The reactions are interesting. The women all fall immediately in love with Gareth. He's a man, he's got a beard to prove it, and yet he doesn't behave like one. He can communicate, and get things done, he can talk, and sing â even talk and sing in French. He's amazing, inspiring. And the men are a bit suspicious of him, possibly jealous that the women like him so much. Plus he gets them to do things they wouldn't normally do, like sing. The basses â Grant, his brother Jeff, captain Angus â look especially grumpy. They don't like the song, Rock the Boat, which doesn't help. I'm a grumpy bass too (though I do like that song). Gareth is indeed amazing, and inspiring. But he's also a teeny bit irritating, in a goody-two-shoes, goody-yellow-trousers kind of way. Bet he was teacher's pet at school, perhaps got a hard time from the other boys. Maybe they called him Gareth GoHo Malone. But now the joke's on them, and on us, the grumpy basses. Gareth could go home with anyone he wanted to (obviously he doesn't, because he's a perfect husband and perfect dad with a perfect homelife too). He's Superman â really, look at the current Radio Times. He is actually Superman on the cover. And we're just grumpy basses, mumbling, grumbling, singing like drains. And he wins them â us â over, of course. He takes them up the White Cliffs of Dover, they loosen up, open up and start to sing, with joy in their hearts, for Albion, and for P&O. It's stirring, and moving, and beautiful. Damn you, Malone, you win, again. Still to come: Birmingham City Council, Sainsbury's, Cheshire Fire and Rescue and Citibank. Over to you on what they should be singing. Dover gets a mention in Fresh Meat (Channel 4), back for a new season, and a new university year. Kingsley (Joe Thomas) says that whole weird thing, him and Josie, is "over like Dover". Actually, Josie has transferred to Southampton, but she's still a permanent presence in the Manchester student house via Skype on an iPad. And later they go down there, for a traffic light party. There's seamen aplenty too â without the "a", I'm afraid. "I've got a sex engine and it runs on cum," says red-trousered JP (Jack Whitehall), all in a froth about the new batch of hotties. Since starting his TV acting career in Fresh Meat, he has pretty much become Mr Right Now. Quite rightly â he's hilarious. It's sticky and smelly, spunky and puerile. There's not much in the way of story, so it has no right to work over an hour. But it does, somehow. Well, I do know how: by being very funny about the funniest â and most tragic â time (it also rings a bit true, amazingly). I think I can actually feel what a good time Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain had creating it. I know I'm having a good time watching. â¢ TV highlights â¢ Full TV listings

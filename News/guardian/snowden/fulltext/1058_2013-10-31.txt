Pope Francis â¦ was the US National Security Agency listening in? Photograph: Galazka/Sipa/Rex â¢ So the US National Security Agency eavesdropped on Pope Francis before and during the Vatican conclave at which he was chosen to succeed Benedict XVI, according to the press in Italy. But it wouldn't do for us to make a fuss about it. For in 1991, before whistleblowing became the rage and when Edward Snowden was just eight years old, Guardian scribes Richard Norton-Taylor and Nick Davies revealed that private and diplomatic conversations of the pope were intercepted by GCHQ. Nothing new. None without sin. â¢ Dangerous days, indeed, with loyalties questioned and too much potential for misunderstanding. Just recently the Motion Picture Association of America â representing the big six Hollywood studios â urged the US government to get tough with countries identified as "notorious markets" for piracy, the "rogue overseas marketplaces". Reports identified Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Ireland. But the call to arms singled out "Northern Ireland's Jonesborough market" as having "historically strong ties to paramilitary groups", selling "an array of counterfeit products". That's South Armagh. The UK. America's mad at you, dear reader. Have a nice day. â¢ And now from Facebook â the people who brought you those beheading videos â an all new squeamishness. No you cannot run an ad, they told Peter Huntley, producer of the Pulitzer prize-winning In the Next Room or The Vibrator Play, scheduled for London's St James theatre this month. The vibrator bit breaches our guidelines. Sticklers for taste and decency. â¢ Strange, the issues that will grip a modern newsroom. At Richard Desmond's Express there is still much talk of the day he apparently tripped over the lead to an electric kettle on the first floor of his headquarters; housing the finance and human resources departments. Soon afterwards, as has been recorded, came the edict from on high: henceforth, electric kettles are banned. Material on the matter reaches us, including communication from the managing editor, who broke the news by email. "Due to health and safety reasons we can no longer use our own kettles. I know a lot of these kettles are your own property so please make sure you take them home with you or they will be confiscated first thing tomorrow morning." This wasn't the fix envisaged, for staff put up with a lot to earn the Desmond shilling. The right to make their own cuppas wasn't to be surrendered lightly. Thus the kettle war began. What about our rights, they said? We're being kettled. Emails record fury on the front line. "At night there are only the fairly useless vending machines. The drinks machine on 2nd floor riverside is new and has not worked properly since it was installed. I'm all for iced soup in summer but not chilled, dehydrated Knorr veggie soup in a cup," wrote one refusnik. "You reckless brewers," wrote another. "You endanger all our lives and the whole fabric of the Northern and Shell building with your dodgy electrical boilers. Being the bright spark I am, from now on I will bring a gas camping stove and pan to make my daily mug of Lapsang Souchong after the usual five pints of lunchtime Stella. That should get around any health and safety concerns." The union has been seeking "a solution to this 'Kettlegate' saga". And what has happened? What always happens when ordinary folk feel bullied. Some have opted for acquiescence and a quiet life. Others continue to fight. â¢ So a few kettles have disappeared, some stayed have put, others have gone underground. They are there; the kettles of rebellion enabling the illicit brewing of tea and coffee. Staff bristle at the reference to health and safety. If that's a priority, they say, what about the mice, the state of the toilets and our long working hours? And how can there be peace without trust? Is this really about health and safety, they ask still, or about channelling people towards the official canteen about which so many have misgivings. "Gasping now. But I refuse to buy coffee and tea from the canteen. And will not be buying anything else from the canteen so long as the kettle ban stays," vows a combatant. Both sides entrenched, one side wearied; a bit thirsty. This won't be over by Christmas. Twitter: @hugh_muir

Neil Hamilton enjoying an oyster. âWe did say in March that after a run of defections Nigel Farage would be a bit more rigorous about the selection process.' Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA â¢ Desperately sad that Neil Hamilton, the former MP, ill-fated litigant, newspaper columnist and end-of-the-pier panto turn didn't make the cut in Ukip's list of MEP candidates. We did say in March that after a run of defections and such as the jailing of former MEP Tom Wise for expenses fraud, Nigel Farage would be a bit more rigorous about the selection process. The result was the so called "fruitcake" test. So many hopes were dashed. And it is a shame in its way, because we still have copies of the famous Guardian front page that carried a picture of Hamilton post his legal entanglement with us over cash-for-questions, and its banner headline, "A liar and a cheat". With a party motif slotted in, it would have made a nice election poster. Oh well, not to be. â¢ An apparent victory as we strive to shore up the terrible relationship between the Tories and the unions by extracting from the party of the name of its new trades union envoy. The previous holder of this very short straw, Richard Balfe, announced on his website biog that he had done his time. "From 2007 to October 2012 he served as Conservative party envoy to the trades union movement," it said. It's a dirty job, was our view, but surely someone wants to do it, and we asked Tory high command who that might be. Answer came there none. Then, last week, with publication of the list newly created peers we saw Balfe at the very top, described as "former MEP and Conservative party envoy to the trade unions and co-operative movement". On our reading, that could mean the new titleholder is the old titleholder. If so, welcome back Brother Balfe. He could have a job for life. â¢ Interesting times for the Catholic aid agency Cafod press team as it thrives under the command of Gordon Brown's former spinmeister Damian McBride. He's about to publish a book about his previous life in Downing Street; Power Trip: A Decade of Plots, Policy and Spin. But one wonders if he is keeping a closer eye on the productivity of his team. Pascale Palmer, the senior press officer, wrote recently on Facebook of her 8am to 4pm shift. "Yesterday it got to 4.30pm and I looked at the clock, whooped with delight, turned off the PC, said bye to everyone and left work. As I unlocked my bike, I saw people eating lunchtime sandwiches. I looked again at the time. 'Twas 14.30, not 4.30. I had to go back, switch on the puter (sic) and explain to everyone what I had done. Oh dear oh dear ..." Downing Street Damian would never have stood for that sort of thing. â¢ Many Parisiens celebrate the return from self-imposed exile of one-time heart throb, now fullâtime eccentric Gerard Depardieu, who, having bemoaned the latest French tax rises, now extols the home comforts of Russia and Chechnya and his friendship with President Putin. Depardieu is back making a film about the origins of the football World Cup. But there's a potential issue because the Parisien newspaper has pictures of him riding helmetless to the set on a scooter. He has enemies, and â unless he has some kind of dispensation â there could be trouble ahead. â¢ It's a high pressure gig meanwhile as secretary of the "D" (defence) notice committee. Nudging British newspapers away from Edward Snowden's national security agency revelations and that sort of thing. But what comes after? For Air Vice-Marshal Andrew Vallance CB OBE MPhil(Cantab) FRAeS, the retiring "D" notice supremo, the quieter life. He'll edit the magazine of the parish of Sunninghill and South Ascot in Berkshire. That was probably need-to-know, but now it's out there. â¢ Finally, in this week's Spectator, Joan Collins puts to rest the allegation that she and her former husband invited others to strip naked and watch porn, having first prepared them all a fish dinner. Just not true, writes Joan. "I'm no Nigella in the kitchen and allergic to seafood, so I wouldn't know how to cook a fish if it stood up on its fins and issued instructions." No nudity, no porn, definitely no fish dinner, she says. Details matter here. Twitter: @hugh_muir

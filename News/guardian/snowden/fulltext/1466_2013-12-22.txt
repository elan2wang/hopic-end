1 Joey Essex was hot favourite to win I'm A Celebrity, but went out early. Lady Gaga made her silver-screen debut in Machete Kills (no, me neither). Robert Galbraith wrote a book.

So said which actor, not without her share of controversy in her younger years, and with a certain amount of tongue poking cheek? 3 "Nolle timere" were poet Seamus Heaney's final words, via text message, to his wife. What do they mean? 4 Supermodel Cara Delevingne made her sort-of screen debut in which bestselling video game? 5 Breaking Bad ended after five fantabulous seasons.

What? 10 "Well, plenty more to come from here. Of course, none of it news, because that will come from Buckingham Palace. But that won't stop us. We'll see you later." That was during the royal birth: later, this broadcasting delight would take to the BBC's screens clutching a ream of photocopying paper, having "mistakenly" carried it on set instead of his iPad. Who? Robin Thicke and Miley Cyrus perform during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. A clue to which question? Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for MTV 11 Whose accoutrement led to its own spoof Twitter feed â Paxman's beard, or (dear God) Dimbleby's tattoo (left)? 12 There's a new Pope, the delightful Francis, who embarked on a no-frills pontiffship to the extent that he drives a 1984 Renault 4 (which surely says a lot about, if nothing else, the power of prayer). Three days after his election, he personally lifted the phone to Buenos Aires to apologetically cancel his daily delivery of what? 13 The asteroid which exploded over Chelyabinsk was the largest natural object to have entered the Earth's atmosphere since the "Tunguska event" in the same country.

Which lorry driver's son from Dundee bested Boris in March? 17 The Boston Marathon bombing, Cleveland kidnappings and George Zimmerman trial all took second place in 2013 on Bing, a search engine most popular in America, to which far-more crucial overseas event? 18 3-D printers are now available on eBay for under Â£1,000. But in which decade did the first fully working version of this apparent cutting-edge technology actually appear? 19 David Bowie had not only a show at the V&A but also a new album, greeted in critical circles by pieces of drooling hagiography.

Have a good day Mr President"? 25 Anfield-born model Hollie May Saker demonstrated, if not quite her sisterhood for the cause, then a spiffing right hand when she punched a topless feminist protester during the Tuileries show for which designer? 26 The Chatsworth Estate came to a lamented end. How? (Clue: it's very much not to do with Downton.) 27 Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Croatia, Morocco: not the past five Eurovision winners, but the chief shooting locations for which HBO mega-series? 28 Which Devon resort saw thousands flocking to its undercliff, following the runaway success of Broadchurch? 29 Peter Capaldi was named as the 12th Doctor. Or maybe the 13th. Which one was John Hurt again? Never mind: who was roughly halfway there; who was the sixth Doctor? 30 "If you're not getting a call from a â â, you've got nothing to worry about." So said South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on the uproar over surveillance of American citizens by the National Security Agency. What, roughly, were the missing words? 31 Which soap star's "bucket list" has so far involved releasing 99 red balloons, riding a Harley-Davidson and dancing at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom? 32 In October the marvellous Frances Quinn "stole" the Bake-Off crown from Ruby Tandoh with a wedding cake themed on which Shakespeare play? 33 And, talking patisserie, of what is a "cronut" a hybrid? 34 Which white boy wrote "Free Nelson Mandela"? And who sang it in the original Coventry band? 35 Which of the 14 British Overseas Territories features, on Trip advisor, just one â one â entry under "nightlife travellers recommend"?

A statement possibly unrivalled this year for its passive-aggressive simpering cattery â but which model-turned-author did Sandals expect, by inference, to have many future weddings? 38 667 Govan Road. Whose early address? (Clue: his autobiography became, on publication, the fastest selling on record.) 39 What, this year, came in pink, white, black, blue or green, and vibrated electronically when the user was eating too fast, or too much, and filled this writer at least with existential despondency for western "values"? 40 Who said: "I don't want to live in a world where everything that I say, everything I do, everyone I talk to, every expression of creativity or love or friendship, is recorded"? 41 Which professional boxer drove to the Sheffield home of a highly abusive Twitter follower, to himself tweet, with a picture of the street: "right Jimbob im here !!!!! someone tell me what number he lives at, or do I have to knock on every door #itsshowtime"? 42 In an extract from her 2013 autobiography, Cleo Rocos recalled the night when she, Kenny Everett and Freddie Mercury smuggled who into a gay bar in south London, dressed as a male model? 43 How many sets did it take Andy Murray to win the Wimbledon men's final? 44 A certain boy band member, much in the news this year, not least for having a shoe thrown at him while on stage in Glasgow, got straight on to Twitter this April to tweet "RIP Baroness Thatcher. x". It says something about her legacy, although perhaps more just about the generation gap, to learn that the first four responses to his epistle were: "Is he your friend?", "May he rest in peace.

Who was that floppy-haired young "singer" dude? 45 Which British newspaper appointed the UK's first-ever female sports editor? 46 Which singer closed down Disneyland, California, commandeered the area in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle and bedecked the place with 15,000 flowers and 10,000 crystals to renew her wedding vows â for the fifth time? 47 Cameraphone footage emerged of a woman who'd forced an aircraft into an emergency landing in Kansas after she refused to stop singing a Whitney Houston song.

God have mercy upon my soul"? 52 Which former soldier's Wikipedia entry was altered in August to respect his wishes for a gender change? (Either Christian name will suffice.) 53 Charles Saatchi said he was wiping cocaine from his wife's nose. Nigella said she didn't have a drug problem, she had a life problem. Among the more quotable elements of the Divorce of the Year was the revelation that Charles Saatchi kept a "huge wodge of cash" â where? 54 "You better watch your backâ¦ I'm gonna rape your ass at 8pm and put the video all over the internet." Which female MP received this Twitter threat, and for standing up for what cause? 55 What links Silvio Berlusconi to Alphonse Capone? 56 Which woman â gasp â became the first conductor of the Last Night of the Proms? 57 "Selfie" was the Oxford Dictionaries' new "word of the year" and has already led to the further delights of the "belfie", "drelfie" and "welfie".

And "prose retellings" of which respective Shakespeare plays are to be undertaken by Margaret Atwood and Howard Jacobson? 68 The cover of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon will forever be associated with who, who died this year? 69 The White House had a particularly bad year, being blown up by terrorists not once but twice. Name either Hollywood blockbuster. 70 "You know, they call me 'that Polish woman'," said the half-French Ingrid Loyau-Kennett in October. "They've never liked me ever since I moved in. I've had eggs and stones thrown at the house." She's been beleaguered repeatedly on her Cornish housing estate â but under what tabloid monicker did the people of Britain take her to their hearts in May, after an incident in southeast London? 71 Which city, founded by the British in 1899 as a simple rail depot on the railroad from Mombasa to Uganda, turned ugly in September? 72 The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers is better known today as what? 73 Rory McIlroy's miserable 2013, which included missing the cut at Muirfield, was widely ascribed to his having changed choice of clubs to Nike. From which brand? 74 The Huffington Post ran the following headline: "Penis-headed Prince William forces apology from â" who? 75 The government's environment secretary Owen Paterson blamed the badgers.

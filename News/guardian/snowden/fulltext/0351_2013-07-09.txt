Government's great disorder The new face of global protest (28 June) rightly connects uprisings from Brazil to Turkey to Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring. Yet explanations flit from bus-fare rises in Brazilian cities to a public park loss in Istanbul to a general distrust of politicians. The underlying common cause remains hidden from view. Consider Brazil. The mass resistance to billions of dollars of public money spent on a football spectacle is a positive development because it leads the world in spurring constructive government response â massive new public investments in public transport and education. On the other side of the globe, clashes between police and protestors over a public park in Istanbul are endlessly reported, but not the neo-liberal programme of the state under whose rule inequality has multiplied and average wages have fallen by a fifth. The underlying global issues and policy choices, however, remain blinkered out. Instead, the claim of the world's largest PR corporation that the driver of all the protests is "distrust of government" is featured, although this claim itself is another symptom of deeper disorder. Governments are distrusted because they have become creatures of private corporate powers funding the politicians, demonising opposition forces and systematically looting public purses and natural resources across continents. Thus the great disorder multiplies â enriching the top, dispossessing the poor and turning the Earth into waste. While protests keep breaking out against misrule, the common cause remains heretical to discuss. John McMurtry Guelph, Ontario, Canada German green-washing You illustrated your cover feature about Germany's economic success (7 June) with a picture showing BMW bonnet badges. I would agree that Germany's Mittelstand (medium-sized companies) are a special thing and I have worked in companies here where the eyes of the employees (from the youngest through to the oldest) still sparkle with pride as they watch the finished product roll out of the workshops. But I have many friends who feel that the realignment of Germany's employment market is turning what used to be a secure, fulfilling environment into a seriously unsettling and at times underpaid "hire-and-fire" culture which is taking its toll both on psychological wellbeing and the general quality of life. But, more than all this, we need to note Angela Merkel's resistance to EU emissions laws, with it becoming clear that Germany will block strict limits on CO2 emissions in order to protect its prestige car industry. It makes me wonder why Germany is building all those wind-turbines and implementing various other environmental measures? German car manufacturers build some of the most oversized and overpowered vehicles on the market, and Merkel's move to protect the production of these obscene status-symbols simply negates all the supposedly green policies which Germany purports to champion. But I shouldn't be surprised because commercial interest and "green-washing" are the order of the day, aren't they? Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany False modification I have just read a piece on a scientific study of pigs fed a diet of genetically modified corn and soy and the negative impacts on the pigs stomach, uterus and general health. Your leader comment (Modify the argument, 28 June) states those pushing genetic modification of food plants ignore the substantive difference between hybridisation and introducing alien genes. They sure do, and have been making this false claim of similarity for decades. My reading of the literature points to a growing problem, not any kind of food revolution. I Strewe Sydney, NSW, Australia â¢ I have always felt that the response in Britain to the introduction of GM food had more to do with BSE than GM. Many people learned from the BSE scandal that we cannot rely on the food industry to make human health and wellbeing its priority, and we cannot rely on our government to make sure they do so. Profit trumps all. In responsible hands, GM foods could probably be of great benefit to humankind, and risks could be eliminated. But where are the responsible hands? If we ever get a better organised and more sane society, the whole concept might get a better reaction, and then we might recognise the value. I'm waiting. Kate Begley North Shields, UK Applause for clapping Charles Nevin's column on clapping (4 July) deserves a round of applause for covering a subject we take for granted and rarely consider. It made me think of the phenomenon Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn relates in The Gulag Archipelago of the hagiographical mass meetings held in Stalinist times. Everyone was encouraged to clap ceaselessly for minutes at a time, with nobody wishing to be the first to stop lest a lack of zeal be noted. Sure enough, in one instance the director of a paper factory became the first to stop and was duly sentenced to 10 years in the gulag. Gives the idea of being clapped in jail a whole different meaning. Barrie Sargeant Otaki Beach, New Zealand Rice and randomness I would like to suggest a friendly correction to Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter's piece, How to place a bet on the statistics (21 June). They assert that, when throwing many grains of rice out onto a calendar laid on the floor, "one thing we can predict for sure is that the rice grains will not space themselves evenly". Actually, the grains might space themselves evenly (although that is a low probability event). As I discuss with my undergraduate statistics students, random does not necessarily mean uneven. This is another aspect of statistics and probability that people are often confused about. Numbers do "go up and down", as the authors state, but sometimes they stay the same. Catherine Ortner Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada Briefly â¢ A quick note to commend Gary Younge on his article Meet a New Generation of Patriotic Americans (21 June). It is courageously willing to recognise idealism, and his interpretation of the whistle blowers' actions is very convincing. The US could redeem its reputation in the eyes of the world by treating these so-called traitors in a humane and even respectful way. V Baseley Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada â¢ Supporters of the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard (5 July) are out to fashion history in a good light for her, but the women in working-class suburbs visited this year by Gillard called her "a back stabber", referring to her role in the removal of Kevin Rudd when she was deputy. And the polls show Labor voters are glad Rudd fought back and retook the leadership. John Fair Dobinson Balwyn, Victoria, Australia â¢ I have just read Heather Stewart on The economy Carney leaves behind (21 June). I have lived in Calgary for 47 years and I'm darned if I can find anywhere the "eight-lane highways which are clogged with oversized pick-up trucks". Jane Todd Calgary, Canada â¢ "Adaptions"? Could Arachne (14 June, 10 across) be alerted to the convention of using actual words in a crossword? Alan Watterson Brunswick Heads, NSW, Australia â¢ I hope to reassure Annie Didcott of her concern over MRI scanning of mail (Reply, 28 June). We are safe from MRI snoopers as standard MRI only detects water, so the old type of envelope seal may be detected, but not the contents. However, on the downside, I always understood that the reason why postage costs in many western countries are so much higher than Singapore and why the mail is so much slower is because the police took so long to read it.

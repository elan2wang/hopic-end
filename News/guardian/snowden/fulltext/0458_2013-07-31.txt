3.44pm ET General Keith Alexander told a conference of hackers on Wednesday that extensive surveillance had disrupted dozens of terrorist attacks but that technical and policy restrictions protected the privacy of ordinary Americans, writes Rory Carroll. “The assumption is our people are just out there wheeling and dealing. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have tremendous oversight over these programmes. We can audit the actions of our people 100%, and we do that.” Addressing the Black Hat convention in Las Vegas, an annual gathering of the information security industry, he gave a personal example: “I have four daughters. Can I go and intercept their emails? No. The technical limitations are in there.” Should anyone in the NSA try to circumvent that, in defiance of policy, they would be held accountable, he said. “There is 100% audibility.” Only 35 NSA analysts had the authority to query a database of US phone records, he said. He rejected suggestions that his staff could monitor all US internet traffic and phone calls. “The fact is, they don’t.” The four-star general, who in addition to the NSA heads the Central Security Service and US Cyber Command, was responding to mounting concern over alleged civil rights violations by post 9/11 intelligence gathering networks. That pressure mounted on Wednesday when the Guardian published details of a programme, called Xkeyscore, which allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals.

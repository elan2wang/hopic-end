âIt's not been much of a silly season, what with Egypt, Syria and Edward Snowden et al. But that hasn't stopped the usual speculation about the Labour leadership. I suspect Ed Miliband is safe for the moment. The only real alternative from three years ago is now in New York, earning a fortune. He isn't an MP now, and why would they swap one Miliband for another? Ed Balls? I think not. Yvette Cooper? She has the same prescriptivist tone as Margaret Thatcher, but without the driving agenda. Chuka Umunna? The bland leading the bland. Alan Johnson would be popular, but I get the sense that he quietly suspects he's not up to the job. Also, he loves being a best-selling author, and between book festivals is enthusiastically writing his follow-up to This Boy. âLike most people I was a shade surprised by the list of 10 finest gags at the Edinburgh fringe. A lot of them seem to be reverse puns: you think of a word or phrase and work out the punchline backwards. It took me one minute to come up with these: "Did you know that Robert Frost was a shoplifter? He sold the stuff on to the bloke next door, because 'good fences make good neighbours.'" "They've renamed the stable lads in Newmarket. They're now called Findus Keepers." "I put far too much cream on my face. Nivea again!" Yes, they're admittedly dreadful, but no worse than the winners. I know it's all about delivery: Tim Vine, for example, does several gags a minute, and you've barely understood one before he's finishing the next. And though all the list was of men's jokes, women do one-liners as well, often better. Our daughter, Amy, has a line in her fringe show: "In my yearbook I was voted the worst and the crappiest. And I was home schooled." It helps if the punchline has some emotional wallop, as if the comedian has fooled themselves. "Hedgehogs. Why can't they share?" Or, "Crime in multistorey car parks. That is wrong on so many levels!" Or, as Bob Monkhouse used to say, "they laughed when I said I wanted to be a comedian. Well, they're not laughing now." âThump! On to our doormat falls the new Lakeland catalogue. Kitchenware porn. I leaf through it, astonished at the amount that they sell. Since everything is essential for your cooking, you will need a kitchen the size of an aircraft hangar to find space â for the Fairy Tale Cottage Mould, clingfilm dispenser, automatic nutmeg grater, electric pie-baker, flour sifter, food processor, hand mixer, chip fryer, digital scales, juicer, ice-cream maker, muffin carrier, plug-in griddle, bread maker, yoghurt kit, electric wok, homemade wine equipment, preservative pan, apple corer, sausage stuffer, egg boiler â the list is unending. Some of the stuff seems entirely pointless, such as the Dalek cake stand ("a magnificent centrepiece for your Doctor Who cupcakes"), the "topsy-turvy cake pans" which allow you to make rectangular cakes, only on a slant, goodness knows why, and the curly-doughnut maker (say goodbye to smooth-sided doughnut misery). The whole catalogue is pitched on the notion that these devices will save you time and effort, but I bet the opposite is true. Suppose you had a kindly guest who, asked what he'd like for breakfast, said "just toast and marmalade for me, please". Oh, dear. First you get the loaf and feed it into the electric bread cutter. You pop the slice in the Dualit hand-built toaster (Â£99.99), then fish it out with the magnetic toast tongs (only Â£1.99). Somehow you find the double-insulated butter dish â keeps butter at an even temperature, year round â then struggle to open the clip-top Kilner jar of marmalade. The full English would take less time. âOscar Wilde was even more prescient than we know. Miss Prism, in The Importance Of Being Earnest, warns Cecily, about to read an economics textbook: "The chapter on the fall of the rupee you may omit. It is somewhat too sensational." Presently, the rupee is falling at an almost sensational speed; from a reasonable sum three years ago, it is worth less than one penny sterling. It would give anyone the vapours: an English schoolgirl or the Indian finance minister. âMany readers have pointed out that Steve Kirby said to Mike Atherton that he had "seen better batters in his fridge", not batsmen. Still odd, since we say "batsmen" here, and who keeps a supply of batter in the fridge? "I've seen better batters in my local chippie" makes more sense. Listening to the Sky commentary on the test, I'm struck by the new terms they use. Stick and ball games have given a lot to the language: "sticky wicket", "good innings," from cricket; "step up to the plate", and "out of left field" from baseball. But now cricket has given us the "doosra" (the ball spins in an un-expected direction), a "jaffa" (any great delivery), "cow corner", part of the pitch where batsmen rarely hit and fielders aren't posted, so cows could graze there undisturbed. We could use all those. "It was a tough interview; the MD threw me a couple of doosras"; "poor old Wilkinson, after that cock-up he's gone to cow corner in Hunstanton", or "your presentation was terrific, what a jaffa!" âGraham Mitton found this on the Thomson Holidays website: "If you decide to pay extra to reserve seats together, you'll get the added bonus of being able to choose your actual seat, free of charge!" This sounds a bit like saying, "If you buy our great value tickets for one of many European destinations, we will fly you there without charging you an extra penny!" And Geoffrey Peake bought a bag of baby spinach at Tesco, helpfully marked "suitable for vegetarians". Roy Farrell was pleased to note that Nytol sleeping tablets "may cause drowsiness".

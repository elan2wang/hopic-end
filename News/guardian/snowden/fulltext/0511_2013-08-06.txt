Military in firm control I am not at all surprised at the military's action in Egypt (Killings fail to end pro-Morsi protest, 2 August). What surprises me is that they waited as long as they did, and that nobody else seems to have seen it coming. From Nasser through to Mubarak, the Egyptian president has always been a military leader. The Arab spring saw the military take a front seat, generously creating the "Supreme Council of the Armed Forces" as a temporary solution. Knowing that the eyes of the world were on them, they stepped aside to allow for attempts at democracy, giving Egyptians the impression of democratic freedoms and reforms. Although Egypt was without a military president since Mohamed Morsi's election, the true power in the country continued to be held by the military, waiting for the right moment to take back full control. The military would have acted the same way against any elected president of Egypt, secular or religious, because any non-military president would be a hindrance to restoring the military-run political system. The only difference between Morsi and other candidates is the timing of the military intervention. Morsi made it easy for the military because he was active in trying to wrest political power from them. Whatever Morsi's motives were, his actions gave the military the chance they were waiting for. In their coup, they can claim that they were acting on the will of the people by removing Morsi from power. John Warkentin-Scott Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada â¢ I am not a Muslim, but it is plain to me that the Egyptian government led by the Muslim Brotherhood has been the victim of a military coup, and that Egyptian secularists have made a Faustian bargain with an army that is unreconstructed from the times of Hosni Mubarak. In those times, the Egyptian army became a byword for torture and murder, as its secularist victims must know, and it has not changed. The proof of this is its slaughter of Muslim brothers protesting the removal of Mohamed Morsi and its hastening to forestall any judicial consideration of those murders. Egyptian secularists will live to regret that they helped to facilitate the installation of a new Mubarak. Geoff Mullen Sydney, Australia Crash was no surprise The train crash in northern Spain was a tragedy for all involved (Train crash driver 'reckless', 2 August). There is no doubt the train driver was driving too fast. He looks set to spend some time in prison. The train company will no doubt be reprimanded but it is unlikely that any company officers will be sent to prison. But that is not the whole story. Those of us who live in Spain are not surprised that such an accident should happen. Every day we see corners cut because of the austerity measures. Maintenance that would have been routinely carried out a few years ago is now neglected. Rubbish bins in the streets that would once have been emptied every day now get emptied every two or three days. Road surfaces deteriorate and are not repaired. Public buildings begin to look like they are about to fall down. But more than that, the salaries of public workers in Spain have been cut by up to 50% and people working in the public sector are now completely demoralised. They work, but without motivation and without any interest in whether what they are doing is correct. The private sector is not much better. So I am not surprised if the train driver lost concentration. He will pay the price. But those who are really to blame will get off scot free â I refer, of course, to the greedy, irresponsible bankers who caused the financial crisis and the worthless, ineffectual regulatory bodies who let them do what they wanted. Alan Williams-Key Madrid, Spain Astounding children Ian Sample's recent report on the results of a study by scientists at University College London (Irregular bedtimes may affect children's brains, 19 July) is of considerable interest, not only because it could have a profound impact on the way parents raise their children, but also because the findings indicate there were significant gender differences in the youngest age groups (three, five and seven). However, what was even more significant to me (and also astonishing) was the fact that apparently all of the three-year-olds in the entire study could read and do maths. Either this was the result of the scientists selecting the three-year-olds from a sample of children with truly exceptional abilities, or, the average three-year-olds in Britain are the most intellectually advanced children in the world! I think, if I was one of the scientists involved in this study, I would want to switch direction and find out how these children were able to develop such wonderful skills at such an early age. Keith E Barnes Qualicum Beach, British Columbia, Canada Progress in Yemen? Your article (Yemenis are living in fear of drones, 26 July) concludes, "So far little has changed in Yemen," the land of ubiquitous qat (narcotic stimulant), the jambiyah (curved dagger) and the futa (men's sarong). Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi has assumed the mantle of president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had juggled a myriad of tribes into a semblance of nation-state, and dealt with a secessionist movement in the once-Marxist south, all the while mollifying the demands both of al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula and the Bush-Obama "war on terror". From the late 20s until the early 60s by way of maintaining the Aden Protectorates, the RAF gratuitously bombed Yemeni villages, albeit with some advance notice: "this is a highly exacting task and the RAF rightly resents any suggestion that bombs are being scattered carelessly or lives endangered" (BBC, 1961, as quoted in Victoria Clark's Yemen). In 1967 Nasser's Egyptian air force dropped mustard gas on villagers in (royalist) north Yemen, killing 500. And now Obama's invisible "wild birds" thrum menacing overhead, engendering nightmares in the children and elderly. "Stricter rules to limit civilian victims" is a progress, of sorts. R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US Propaganda piece The Letter from Honduras (26 July) does not contain a single comment on the political situation in the country, and looks like a thinly disguised propaganda piece for the (unnamed) church to which "Pastor Antonio" belongs. After a brief experiment in democracy, Honduras is again ruled by a dictatorship, abetted and supported by the US. Many fundamentalist North American denominations are active in the country, providing schooling and services exactly as described in the letter (with whose money?), but effectively acting as powerful agents for the status quo (though they would claim to be "apolitical"). Is Pastor Antonio's church one of these? Does the author of the letter belong to the same church? What is he doing in Honduras? I think we should be told. Giorgio Ranalli Ottawa, Canada Xenophobia no surprise Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd's draconian announcement of harsh treatment for asylum seekers in a desperate bid for the xenophobic vote in marginal seats in the upcoming federal election is a profound disappointment, but no real surprise (Australia scraps the welcome mat, 26 July). It's a strategy based on the latest manifestation of an old fear of alien hordes descending on a mostly empty continent that's been a strong feature of our society since early colonial times. Such is the desperation in our federal electioneering - and the general fragility of our so-called liberal democracy â as polling day approaches. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Actions speak louder Why expect Edward Snowden to be the great orator (Snowden wrong to embrace Putin, 19 July)? Would Peter Beaumont rather Snowden have died heroically on his battlefield than get his words wrong? Snowden is but a brave soldier now in a position of capture. He is no political leader or journalist. Judging him for his suggestion that Russia stands against human rights violations clearly ignores his tactical speechmaking. He is trying to save his life. His actions speak far louder than his words. Sophie Jerram Wellington, New Zealand Collateral damage "The citizens of the US have an absolute right to go about their business without being slaughtered," says Deborah Orr (The US needs to take a long look at itself, 26 July) and rightly so. However, the best way to stop what she calls "the hateful tongues of people crass enough to insist that the US had got what was coming to it" on 9/11 will be to extend this "absolute right" to the people in Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq who are considered collateral damage of the US lethal drone policy, to mention only a few of the victims of US foreign policy. Lucila Makin Cambridge, UK Briefly â¢ How could you write about Chris Froome's great victory in the Tour de France and mention his British team-mates without even a nod to his right-hand man, Richie Porte (26 July)? Porte selflessly pushed Froome over the finish line much as Froome did the same for Bradley Wiggins last year. For an Aussie to support a Pom like that against the background of the Lions tour and the Ashes was above and beyond the call. Paul Probyn London, UK â¢ Women novelists on Â£10 notes: Jane Austen.

Alastair Campbell says newspapersâ ânegativity, hype and lack of balance have helped turn people away from the pressâ. Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA Efforts by media moguls such as Rupert Murdoch and Paul Dacre to maintain power is likened to the way union leaders in the 1980s were overtaken by people demanding change by Alastair Campbell, the former press secretary to Tony Blair. Campbell argues in two lectures due to be delivered at Cambridge University this week that the power of the two most influential newspaper figures in Britain is in decline due to falling print sales, lost credibility and rising public awareness of their methods as well as new sources of information, including social media. He warns: "The negativity, overblown hype and lack of balance have helped turn people away from the press as a prime source of news. The rise in social networks is in part based on the concept of 'friends' â we do not believe politicians as we used to; we do not believe the media; we believe each other." "The papers", Campbell claims, "think their decline is about technology. I think it is as much about their values and their journalism." In the lectures to the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities at Cambridge University, he insists he is optimistic about journalism, saying he "welcomes the impact of social media in breaking open the agenda setting of a self-serving political and economic elite". The relationship between journalism and the public is changing, largely in the public's favour, he claims, as the public challenges what appears in newspapers. Seen as one of the toughest press secretaries in Downing Street of the modern era, he claims "the real evil of narrow concentration of press ownership by a clutch of wealthy rightwing men, most of whom do not pay taxes here, is that it leads to a narrow set of values and interests within the news agenda". He adds: "As the public know more of the way the press operate, so their power weakens, and politicians can represent the public interest, not their own or that of the media". He says the Murdoch-Dacre generation "cannot see, not least since Leveson, their similarity with union leaders in the Thatcher era, desperately clinging on to power and systems being overtaken by people demanding change. The change is happening, and will happen, in part because of public anger, campaigning by victims and activists, and also because a younger generation is better at reading the rhythms of change." He accuses newspapers of writing "self-serving bilge" about the threat posed to press freedom by the Royal Charter on press regulation drawn up by parliament. He says: "What Leveson proposed, and what the Royal Charter now says, does not even come close to establishing regulation of the press: it proposes a body to certify that any new self-regulator is independent. That is underpinning, not 'state control'." He says: "If any other walk of life had been exposed for so much wrongdoing, given rise to so much public disgust, and then still made a claim to be capable of a self-regulatory system authored by the likes of Paul Dacre and Guy Black, a Tory peer and one of the succession of press groupies who ran the PCC, they would be insulted, hounded, vilified." Campbell claims the public has seen through the press lies about Leveson. "Press freedom is over. A lie. Politicians will decide what you read. A lie. Investigations into stories like MPs' expenses could not happen. A lie. There will be pre-publication censorship. A lie. Editors will go to jail if they don't sign up. A lie. This is about protecting politicians and celebrities. A lie." Campbell claims instead that the Royal Charter "is about protecting people without power or wealth or fame who can have their lives destroyed by inhumane and illegal journalistic activity". Campbell also questions whether the Guardian, the New York Times and the journalist Glen Greenwald went too far in publishing the secrets leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. He claims the issue "is one of the biggest questions facing contemporary journalism". He suggests: "What Greenwald, the Guardian, the NYT and others have been close to saying is that journalists are as, if not more, able to decide on public interest and safety than the state and its security services. That is a vast claim which cannot be made with confidence." Snowden, he says, is "a source with a treasure trove of damaging, sensational, secret information â with legitimate questions about why he had access to it all, by the way. That does not make him God, even for the Guardian. It makes him a source. Less Deep Throat than deep technology." Editors, he says, "have to decide what to do with the source material, and that is best done in a journalism framed by an agreed regulatory framework, moral codes of behaviour, and mature dialogue".

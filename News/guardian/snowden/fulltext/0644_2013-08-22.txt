Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters â¢ Many worry about association with BAE Systems; all those arms that end up in oppressive regimes, all those allegations of corruption that cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars. The taint of rubbing with such shoulders can be overwhelming. Yet we must give credit where it's due: Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, soldiers on regardless. Maybe she was nervous, though, because something strange happened on Thursday at the launch of a new sponsorship deal with BAE. The usually sharp Nicholl took to reminiscing about the glory days of the 2012 London Olympics, of watching "Tim Henman win gold". It was Andy Murray. How to explain it, other than the BAE effect? â¢ Meanwhile, in light of all the shenanigans that have followed the release of secret information by Edward Snowden â the most recent being the detention at Heathrow of David Miranda â can we trust America's National Security Agency to keep a sense of proportion about the right to privacy and the rights of individuals? One hesitates to answer yes, especially on re-reading James Bamford's 2002 book, Body of Secrets: How America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ Eavesdrop on the World. Bamford was taken by the intercept operators' motto: "In God we trust, all others we monitor." That means the likes of us. And yet, on leafing through, one can't help but be puzzled at the agency's approach to whistleblower Snowden. What was it that Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan said in 1997, while director of the NSA? "The public has a duty to watch its government and keep it on the right track." And what about Lieutenant General Michael Hayden in 2000, then NSA director himself? "The American people have to trust us and in order to trust us they have to know about us," he said. Sounds like they should be giving Snowden a promotion and a pay rise. â¢ For who wouldn't welcome a rise in this the age of austerity? Everyone's tightening their belts. Here's how it is being done in Ireland. A reader proceeds to a bank to change some money. It seems the right place. But it isn't. "Oh, don't you know it's Wednesday," she is told. "We have Cashless Wednesday and Cashless Thursday. But we will have cash on Friday and Monday and Tuesday. Is there anything else we can help you with?" What next? The pub with no beer? â¢ Who will boss Ukip now that the chief executive, Will Gilpin, has left, denouncing his former colleagues as a bunch of "amateurs", we asked on Wednesday. We hoped against hope that it would be the "liar and a cheat", Neil Hamilton, whose prospects were flagged up by the Telegraph. But already the knives are out. It won't be, says a siren voice. "Stand down the bunting, streamers and party hats." Still, Neil won't be surprised, for since his dreadful loss against us in the courts, so many have moved against him, but yet he survived and made it all the way to panto in Kettering. If he wants the job, who will stop him? â¢ Finally, some good news. On Monday we highlighted yet another scrape involving that troublesome octogenarian campaigner Pat Arrowsmith, who received a letter about an unpaid fine and a warning that she could be arrested "at any time or place". This was perturbing for Pat â not because of the prospect of arrest (as a direct action type she has been arrested too many times to remember), and not specifically at the prospect of jail (she has been there too. On one occasion she was sent to Askham Grange open women's prison in North Yorkshire, from which she quickly escaped before being equally quickly rearrested.) It was rather the sense that, though her principles remain intact, she's 83, and a bit too old for handcuffs and cold floors these days. So it is a pleasure to report that since our item this week the world has turned, and the landscape is much altered, with the result that Pat can probably go about her day without fear of the knock on the door or the tap on the shoulder. Can't elaborate. But that false nose and blonde wig we sent her â¦ she can probably send them back. Twitter: @hugh_muir â¢ This article was amended on 23 August 2013. The original quoted Liz Nicholl as saying she sat with "Gordon Brown, the prime minister". UK Sport says she actually referred to sitting with Gordon Brown "and" the prime minister.
